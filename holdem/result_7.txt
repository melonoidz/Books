cards may have a minimum expected value of 2 big
blinds on a certain flop. Yet if he risked on average

8 big blinds to get that opportunity, then nothing
suggests we are being exploited.

While the above cannot be proven directly, this
is likely the outcome which results from optimal
preflop play. The 3-bet cold caller cannot defend
enough on many flop textures to prevent the 3-

the 3-bettor risked enough money preflop that
this is not a problem. Also, if a player 3-bets a hand
which is too weak preflop, he'll flop poorly with a
high probability and his expectation for the hand
will be negative.

In general, our 3-bet calling range does quite well
on boards which are jack high or higher. ThatÅfs

In addition, this flop strongly connects with
our opponent's 3-bet bluffing range. Low suited
connectors and gappers make excellent 3-bet
bluffs, and nearly all these hands flopped either a
pair, draw, or both. Furthermore, overcard hands

by Raising

Raising is also an option in 3-bet pots. If we call

pot, the pot will be 50 big blinds. As previously
explained, we can solve for how much the pot needs

50 is the starting pot size,
200 is the final pot size, and

to remember and will rarely if ever be used.
The reason for this is it will be difficult, if not
impossible, to bet the turn after raising the flop and
then fold to a check-raise all-in. More specifically,
once we bet the turn, we'll have only 36.8 big blinds
remaining. As such, we'll almost always be getting

reasons, making a small turn bet in a 3-bet pot after
raising the flop is ineffective.

Another option is to raise the flop with the
intention of only utilizing the flop and turn to get
stacks all-in. This means there are effectively two
streets left to act and once again the bet sizing
formula can be used to estimate what our bet and

Nevertheless, there are many problems with
raising to 37.5 big blinds. Specifically, our flop raise

ItÅfs best to pick a flop raise sizing which is small
enough so that our opponent canÅft easily go all-

we donÅft need to raise in 3-bet pots to get all the
money in by the river, it rarely, if ever, makes sense
to raise unless we have a strong but vulnerable
hand. This will usually only occur on wet flops, but
many players are often afraid to make small raises
on these board textures because they fear giving
their opponent odds to call with a draw. However,
allowing our opponent to make profitable calls with
his draws is not necessarily a problem.

HereÅfs an example. We open in the cutoff and call

call with some or all of his gutshots. Therefore,
some players often think this means our raise sizing
must be bad since we didnÅft make our opponent fold

the turn.

Moving on, letÅfs simplify things a bit and assume
that if we call our opponent's flop bet when he has
a gutshot then his expected value is 9 big blinds.
This seems reasonable since heÅfll make a straight on
the turn 8.5 percent of the time, the pot is already
large, and there are implied odds. Yet if we raise the
minimum on the flop, even if he can profitably call
with a gutshot, heÅfs likely only barely getting the
price he needs to call. In other words, it would not
be surprising if calling a raise with a gutshot here
has an expected value as low as only 1 big blind.

So in this example, despite the fact that our
opponent can profitably call our raise with all of his
gutshots, by raising instead of calling, we greatly
decrease his expectation. By the way, this feeling
of just barely getting odds to call and hating it
should be familiar to even novice players. While
oftentimes our bet or raise sizing will be designed to
make the expected value of many of our opponentÅfs

call with some of his draws and force him to play
the turn out of position. This results in his range
being weak on the turn and allows many of our turn
bluffs to be highly profitable.

As such, making small raises to around 25 to 28
big blinds on the flop is likely ideal. This forces
our opponent to still defend aggressively against
our flop raises since he must defend significantly
more than half of his range, as well as forces
him to constantly play the turn out of position.

Introduction

Before moving on to turn play, you should stop for
amoment and congratulate yourself for making
it over halfway through the theory section of
this book and think about all that has alreaded
been covered. Although weÅfve only discussed
preflop and flop play in detail, solid flop play is
not possible without having some knowledge of
the frequencies and ratios necessary for turn play.
Likewise, concepts such as equity, bet sizing, and
when bluffing any two cards should be profitable,
will apply on the turn in the same manner as they
did on the flop. In fact, even though little effort has
been put in specifically trying to improve our turn
play, we should already have an idea of what to
do in most spots simply by applying the concepts
previously discussed.

In other words, most of the theoretical concepts
necessary for excellent turn play have alreadyd:\work\kindle\holdem\372.png @@ been introduced. And while some repetition will
be useful, our primary focus when analyzing this
street will be to learn new frequencies and ratios
and focus on the aspects of turn strategy which
differ from what was necessary for the flop. This is
especially important because the pot won't always
be the same size on the turn, and itÅfs common for
ranges to now be more defined.

Lastly, itÅfs important to note that despite what
many people think, the turn is not an especially
troublesome street. Many players often think this
because their strategy is poor on the flop, and thus
their turn range will include many hands which are
difficult and awkward to play. So good flop strategy
should ensure our turn range will be reasonably
balanced on the majority of turn cards, and this
makes taking the correct line much easier to
determine and execute.d:\work\kindle\holdem\373.png @@ Raising a Turn Bet

After Calling the Flop

We'll start our discussion of turn play by
estimating the correct bluffing to value raising ratio
on the turn when facing a bet. However, unlike on
the flop in single raised pots where no post-flop
betting has yet occurred, when our opponent bets
on the turn, the pot will not always be the same size.
In addition, each player is likely to have a different
range on the turn, with the flop caller having a
mostly condensed range and the flop bettor having
primarily a polarized range. Nevertheless, when we
do face a turn bet in position, our bluffing to value
raising ratio will change based on whether our
opponent is betting 15 big blinds into a 20 big blind
pot or 6 big blinds into an 8 big blind pot.

That is, on the turn, the pot will be around 8 big
blinds if the flop checked through and around 20
big blinds if a flop bet was called. And as was shown
when analyzing flop play, we'll need to call or raise
at least 57.1 percent of the time to prevent ourd:\work\kindle\holdem\374.png @@ opponentÅfs 75 percent pot-sized bets from showing
an immediate profit.

On the turn, our opponent should not likely be
able to profitably bet any two cards after we call his
flop bet. This is especially true if we didnÅft defend
the flop unreasonably aggressively and mostly
defended by calling. In this case, his flop bluff
sometimes succeeded, and even when it didnÅft, he
usually got the opportunity to improve on the turn
and continue bluffing. In other words, if we fold at
a reasonable frequency to our opponent's flop bets,
heÅfll effectively pay very little money on average
to see the turn, and since he gets to see the turn so
cheaply, we cannot allow him to profitably bluff
with any two cards or heÅfll never check-fold the
flop.

We've already discussed how to defend against our
opponentÅfs turn bets if he bets 15 big blinds intoa
20 big blind pot and we want to defend by calling,
so now letÅfs consider raising. Once again, we can
begin by analyzing what sizing weÅfd need to use if
we wanted to raise and bet equal fractions of the pot
on the turn and river. Note the starting pot size is 50
big blinds since thatÅfs the size the pot would be if we
just called our opponentÅfs turn bet.d:\work\kindle\holdem\375.png @@ 55R? = 200>

R=2.00
That is, the pot needs to grow to double its previous
size with each additional round of raising or
betting, and if the pot doubles from 50 to 100 big
blinds on the turn, we need to raise our opponentÅfs
turn bet of 15 big blinds to 40 big blinds and follow
through with around a 50 big blind river jam.

However, the problem with raising our opponentÅfs
turn bet to 40 big blinds is we leave, relative to the
size of the pot, little money behind. In particular,
if our opponent goes all-in on the turn after our
raise, the pot will be 150 big blinds and we'll have
only 50 big blinds remaining. This means we'll
get 3-to-1 odds to call and need only 25 percent
equity for calling to be profitable. Thus, it becomes
very difficult for us to raise the turn and fold to
our opponent's turn jam, especially since heÅfs
guaranteed to realize the equity of his bluffs and
will win a massive pot if we fold.

Notice that this is no different than what occurs
in 3-bet pots when we raise on the flop and bet the
turn without going all-in. That is, itÅfs simply not
effective to raise or bet on the turn in position and
leave such little money behind as our opponent cand:\work\kindle\holdem\376.png @@ then go all-in to destroy our positional advantage
and we'll almost always be priced into calling.

As such, a small turn raise is usually more effective
than a large one since this forces our opponent to
defend a wider range and encourages him to call.
This also allows us to more frequently play the river
in position. However, there are times when large
raises are appropriate and we must not get into the
habit of thinking only one sizing works in this spot.

So letÅfs instead suppose we raise our opponentÅfs 15
big blind turn bet to 33 big blinds and plan to bet
all-in for 57.5 big blinds if we do bet the river. This
bet sizing makes it more difficult for our opponent
to defend by only jamming or folding against our
turn raise, as well as results in him winning less
money when we do fold.

Just as before, itÅfs easiest to visualize the situation
by working backwards. If we raise our opponentÅfs
turn bet to 33 big blinds and he calls, the pot will
be 86 big blinds on the river. If we then bet 57.5 big
blinds, 71.4 percent of our river bets must be value

the turn. More specifically, our opponent may have
checked a very strong hand planning to check-raise,

However, raises this large are unlikely to occur in
practice. ThatÅfs because our opponent will usually
have many nut-type hands in his range which
unsuccessfully attempted to value check-raise the
flop in addition to any strong hands he made on the
turn. As such, we'll want to raise a bit less. For this
reason, a more reasonable raise size to around 18 to
20 big blinds is usually preferred.

Therefore, overbetting the river will often be the
best option if our turn raise is called. The reason
for this is weÅfre more likely to raise on coordinated
board textures so our opponent doesnÅft get to
cheaply see additional cards, and these are the same
board textures where he'll often be afraid and will

draws on this board texture, and calling risks him
being outdrawn by our bluffs or losing value if the
river card scares us into checking back.

In contrast, we should be less likely to raise on
board textures where our opponent will feel
comfortable calling with his strong hands. That
is, the board textures where he feels comfortable
letting our bluff raises see an additional card are
usually the same board textures where we feel
comfortable slowplaying until the river.

Check After Calling the Flop

There are a few possible types of hands our
opponent can have if he checks the turn after
betting the flop. The most common is a bluff heÅfs
planning to check-fold. Remember, our opponentÅfs
value betting to bluffing ratio should increase on
the turn, and the most obvious way to do this is to
give up some bluffs that were bet on the flop which
now have little chance of improving on the river.

Our opponent may also have a medium strength
hand which he plans on check-calling. This
commonly occurs when his flop bluff improves to a
medium strength hand on the turn, such as when

the flop, he may have bet a marginal strength made

Lastly, our opponent can be planning to check-
raise using around a 1-to-1 ratio of value check-
raises to bluff check-raises. As we saw when
analyzing out of position flop play, check-raising is
extremely effective at punishing players who value
bet too often or bet too big. ThatÅfs because every
strong hand our opponent value check-raises allows
him to check-raise bluff additional hands in a
balanced range. Also, heÅfs more likely to check-raise
on turn board textures where he has a difficult time
check-calling and giving free cards is risky.

A substantial leak most players have is that they
do not adjust their turn bet sizing based on the
strength of their opponentÅfs checking range. More
specifically, bigger bets are more effective on board
textures where our opponent has many medium
strength hands which want to check-call, and

smaller bets are more effective on board texturesd:\work\kindle\holdem\394.png @@ where he'll not likely check-call but often check-

tens or nines, that he may want to bet on the flop
and check-call on the turn, this is not a flop texture
where heÅfs likely to bet with the intention of only
betting a single street for value. As a result, betting
smaller on the turn makes his turn check-raises less
effective and forces him to widen his turn check-
calling range, and this further allows us to utilize
the value of position on the river.

In other situations, we'll want to bet a bit larger.
Suppose the same action and the same Kv73
flop as before, only now assume the turn comes the
Q instead of the 2 @. This turn card puts many
marginal strength hands into our opponentÅfs range,

the hands he'll check-fold have some equity
against our bet, and making him constantly
fold hands with 10 or 15 percent equity is
significant.

2. Betting both the turn and the river allows us to
bluff more hands while remaining balanced. In
other words, we can bluff more if two rounds of
betting are utilized rather than just one.

checks wider on the turn by check-calling. This

small reward, but when it fails, heÅfs much worse off

After Checking Back the Flop

If our opponent has checked both the flop and the
turn, heÅfs twice shown weakness. As a result, it will

just because itÅfs profitable to bet does not mean we
should bet our entire range, and betting a polarized

opportunity on the flop with the intention to
bet the turn if our opponent checks again. This
is an important concept thatÅfs often overlooked.
Players who refuse to pass up profitable bluffing
opportunities with weak hands often have a
transparent range on the turn and can easily be
exploited.
