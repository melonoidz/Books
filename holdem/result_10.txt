an opportunity to bet or raise that he wouldnÅft
otherwise have.

But when we bet the river in position, it reopens
the betting and gives our opponent the opportunity
to check-raise with a balanced range of value hands
and bluffs. And when he does this, both calling
and folding with most of the hands in our range
will have an expected value of zero meaning we'll

bet-folding the river in position, weÅfll not only lose
our bet to hands which beat us, but our bet and the
pot will also effectively be lost to hands which our
opponent bluffs in a balanced check-raising range.

LetÅfs illustrate this with an example. On the river,
we're in position and have 80 big blinds remaining
and the pot is 40 big blinds. If we bet 20 big blinds,
our opponent has the opportunity to go all-in for

Nevertheless, bet-folding on the river in position

expected value of betting relative to checking.

EV of betting relative to checking = (betsize)
(frequency opponent calls with the worst hand) -
(bet size)(frequency opponent calls or check-raises
the better hand) - (bet size + pot size)(frequency

value betting to be superior to checking, our
opponent must call with the losing hand frequently
enough to overcome the fact that weÅfll sometimes
fold the best hand to our opponentÅfs check-raise
bluffs. Notice that simply solving for the expected
value of our river bet won't tell us if betting or
checking is superior since checking has a positive
expectation as well. So our goal isnÅft to bet if
betting has a positive expected value, but rather if
betting has a greater expected value than checking.d:\work\kindle\holdem\507.png @@ Therefore, if the expectation of betting relative to
checking is positive, betting is our best strategy.

Furthermore, on the river, make sure to note our
opponent will not usually be able to check-raise all
of his hands which beat our value betting hand.

He has to make sure his value check-raises beat
over half the hands in our check-raise calling range
or else calling will be more profitable than check-
raising. As such, there are many different variables
in this equation, and this requires us to estimate
several of our opponentÅfs frequencies.

percent of his hands will be strong enough to value

2.1 percent of hands so his range is balanced. Lastly,
assume he calls with the best hand 10 percent of
the time. These values can be plugged into the
previous formula to determine the expected value
of betting relative to checking. And in this case the

correct answer then seeing how accurate our
prediction was. For example, we learned previously

around a 2-to-1 bluffing to value raising ratio when
raising the flop in position. Yet if we were to ask a

how many bluff raises he should have in his flop

even. Due to these two assumptions, position will

out of position.

The optimal bet sizing in this situation is 0.83 pot

Another important point to mention is when stack
sizes are shallow and going all-in is an option this
formula won't work very well for determining
whether or not to bet when out of position.

The reason for this is that our opponent has no
opportunity to raise after we go all-in, and by going
all-in for a small amount, we force him to call with
a wide range. In fact, itÅfs sometimes correct to go
all-in when out of position even if weÅfre beat by

Effects

Since cards in our hand cannot be in our
opponentÅfs range, our holdings will almost always

the river. For instance, when bluffing, our hands
removal effect is often the sole determinant
for whether our bluff has a positive or negative
expected value.

Since there are no additional cards to come, all of
our river bluffs will have zero equity when called.
This was not the case for preflop, flop, and turn play
since even our weakest bluffs had some equity. As
such, we always emphasized bluffing with hands
which retained their equity well since they hada
chance to outdraw our opponent. And although
removal effects were still present on previous
streets, they were usually much less significant
than the concept of simply bluffing with hands
which best retain their equity. So it made sense tod:\work\kindle\holdem\523.png @@ largely ignore this effect and concentrate on more
significant concepts.

Furthermore, ranges are usually quite wide on
previous streets so removal effects often have a
limited impact on our opponentÅfs range. While
itÅfs true holding a top pair hand on the flop means
sheÅfll have one-third fewer top pair combinations,
there are usually so many strong and weak hands
in his range that removal effects rarely significantly
alter it. But this isnÅft always the case on the river
since ranges are usually more defined with fewer
combinations of hands. ItÅfs thus common for our
holding to significantly change our opponentÅfs
betting or calling frequency because we remove a
large fraction of hands from his range.

HereÅfs a simple example. On the river, our
opponent checks to us and we bet a single pot sized
bet. Since we risk one pot sized bet to win one pot
sized bet, he must call exactly 50 percent of the time
to keep us indifferent to bluffing.

Moreover, letÅfs suppose our opponentÅfs river
checking range includes 100 hand combinations

LetÅfs examine a couple board textures and discuss
the type of hands which will have beneficial and
detrimental removal effects when bluffed. For each
of these boards, assume we called a cutoff open on
the button, our opponent bet the flop, turn, and
river, and we're debating if we should bluff raise.
Hand No. 1: Flop:Qv8 v4 Åë;Turn:J #; River: K&. Here
we should not likely bluff raise with missed flush
draws since these hands likely block many hands in

like the 7 v 6 v, then our opponent canÅft be bet-

bet-calling.

If our opponent is betting the river with many
sets, two pairs, straights, and bluffs, then bluff
raising a hand like the T&T will likely be best.
ThatÅfs because tens block half of his ace-ten and
ten-nine combinations. Additionally, he'll likely
fold most if not all of his his two pairs to our raise.
When bluffing in a spot like this, itÅfs important to
see how many combinations we block in both our

Although overbetting has already been addressed
in previous sections, itÅfs worth discussing
specifically with regards to the river. ThatÅfs because
overbets work best when our opponent called on
a wet board texture and the next community card
was a blank. Furthermore, since there are no streets
left to act on the river, we have only one round of
betting left to get all-in. (Remember, when betting
with a perfectly polarized range itÅfs always best to
get all-in by showdown.) This usually requires us
to make a very large river bet when our opponent
cannot be strong.

Since there are four community cards on the turn,
there will usually be many draws in each playerÅfs
range. After all, even if the flop came rainbow,
the turn will bring a flush draw just under three-
fourths of the time and some straight draws will
almost always be possible. So while there are some

In addition, recall our betting range gets stronger
on each street as we bluff less. Usually, we'll check-
fold our weakest hands on the turn and continue
to bluff with our better bluffs. As a result, many of
our turn bluffs will often be flush draws or straight
draws. This wasnÅft the case on the flop since we
usually needed many bluffs in our range that we
regularly bet overcards or hands with 3 to the flush
and 3 to the straight. But on the turn, bluffs usually
have more equity and are more likely to make a very
strong hand on the following street when compared
to flop bluffs.

When our opponent calls our turn bet, itÅfs
important to assess how many draws are in our
range which can outdraw any strong hands our

call with a very strong hand and we should consider
betting smaller.

description of why our opponent should or

when facing a bet. To better visualize the hand,
assume we are in the cutoff against a button cold

is easy on these boards because there are either
few or no flush and straight draws possible or our
opponent can have a full house. In the case of the
QvQa7#2Åë board, no straight draws or flush
draws are possible, so our opponent should call

In the case of the A@A J 4@ board, there
will often be six combinations of ace-jack in our
opponentÅfs range on the flop and turn which he
can comfortably slow play. These hands are not
vulnerable to being outdrawn by our gutshots and

how much equity it has. Although models are still
important for visualizing situations, much more
precise bet sizings and frequencies can usually be

In order to consider value betting a hand in
position, our holding must win at showdown once
called over 50 percent of the time. ItÅfs also common
to value bet a hand hoping our opponent will fold,
but we should be careful not to bet too aggressively

Introduction

Similar to the way 3-bet pots arenÅft more difficult
to play than single raised pots, multiway pots arenÅft
more difficult to play than heads up pots. Players
often find them more troublesome only because
they learn through a trial and error approach and
in online games most hands are played heads up to

understanding of theoretical poker, itÅfs unnecessary
to play millions of hands before feeling comfortable
with how to play against multiple opponents.

In many ways, multiway pots are actually easier
to play than heads up pots since players need to
defend a smaller fraction of their range when facing
a bet. More specifically, we wonÅft usually need to
defend weak hands which are often difficult to play

will play more loosely to try to stack the fish. So
while we'll mostly focus on how to play in multiway
pots against strong opponents, always remember
theory is also a useful tool for exploiting weak
players and taking their stack before someone else
can.d:\work\kindle\holdem\547.png @@ Hand Strength
on the Flop

Just as was the case for heads up single raised pots,
an out of position bettor should not usually be
allowed to profitably bet any two cards. However,
since there is more than one player who can defend
against a bet, each active player needs to defend
only a fraction of his range to prevent the bettor
from making an immediate profit on his bluffs. This
ultimately results in players seeing the turn with
stronger ranges than they otherwise would.

How much each player should defend depends
on their range and position. Put differently, each
player wonÅft defend the same percentage of hands
when facing a bet. However, we can get a general
idea of how aggressively each player must defend
by assuming they each defend the same percentage
of hands in a combined effort to prevent the bettor
from profitably betting any two cards.

LetÅfs suppose the player out of position bets 75
percent of the pot on the flop and the remaining
players combined will defend aggressively enough
so this flop bet only succeeds 40 percent of thed:\work\kindle\holdem\548.png @@ time. In other words, the remaining players must
defend 60 percent of the time combined against
the flop bet. Remember, when figuring out how
often each player needs to defend in a situation like
this, itÅfs not as simple as taking the total defending
frequency (in this case 60 percent) and dividing by
the number of players remaining. ThatÅfs because
sometimes multiple players will have a hand strong
enough to defend. Instead, we must calculate how
often each player must fold so the bettor wins 40
percent of the time and from there figure out how
often each player needs to defend.

Given the previous assumptions, if there are three
players on the flop (so two players can defend
against the bet), then each player would fold 63.2
percent of their flopping range.

X?=04>
X = 0.632
Since each player can fold 63.2 percent of the time,

each player should defend only 26.3 percent of
the time. So given the above assumptions, if four
players see the flop, theyÅfll defend less than half as
many hands as they would when heads up.

In general, most players significantly
underestimate how much stronger a hand should
be to bet, call, or raise when multiway. Top pair
hands and even overpairs will regularly not be
strong enough to bet or raise on many board
textures where three or more players see the flop.
Furthermore, weak players often use close to thed:\work\kindle\holdem\550.png @@ same range regardless of how many opponents they

players, in a live setting itÅfs amore common
occurrence that pots will include many players.
ThatÅfs because live play is usually full ring where
more players have the option to see the flop and live
players are often too loose preflop. One reason why
otherwise overly tight players, (assuming the rake
isnÅft too high relative to the stakes), can still do well
in games against soft opponents even if they have a
very limited understanding of poker. And this also
means that calling with speculative hands hoping
to flop either a set or draw is a strong play against
weak opponents who will regularly invest too much
money in the pot with top pair.
