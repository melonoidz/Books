Many players rely on almost always winning at

Nevertheless, we'll usually need to bet the flop
reasonably often ourselves, as well as defend our
flop checks aggressively enough so that their flop

That is, on the flop, we can either give our

flop must often be check-folded.)

We can calculate the minimum expected value
of the worst hand in our opponentfs range on
the flop based on how aggressively wefre betting
and defending our checks. This is accomplished
by calculating how often our opponent gets the

opportunity to bluff and how profitable those bluffs
are.

Letfs start with a simple example. The pot is 8 big
blinds and when a player bets, hefll always bet 6 big
blinds. Furthermore, letfs assume wefre checking
the flop 60 percent of the time and defending 45
percent of our flop checks. Lastly, letfs also assume
our opponent has a weak hand which will always
fold if we bet the flop, but will bluff if we check

profitable. This produces an expectation of at least
1.02 big blinds for our opponentfs weakest hand.d:\work\kindle\holdem\306.png @@ minimum EV of opponentfs hand =

As can be seen, with the above assumptions, the
weakest hand in our opponentfs range on the flop
has an expected value of at least 1.02 big blinds.
Thatfs because we won't always bet the flop, and
once we check, our opponent can profitably bet

Furthermore, notice this is the minimum expected
value of our opponentfs hand rather than its actual
expected value since wefll often defend by check-

In addition, be sure to understand that the
expected value of our opponentfs weakest hand was
calculated on the flop before we bet or checked, not
the expected value of his bluff. Notice that if we
bet, the expected value of our opponentfs weakest
hand is zero (since hefll always fold), and if we
check, his expected value will be greater than 1.02
big blinds (since hefll always get the opportunity to
bluff). Here, the minimum expected value of our

on each playerfs range and the flop texture.

reasonable.

Herefs an example. We open in the cutoff, the
button calls, and the blinds both fold. If wefre

hands is 2 big blinds or greater, does this seem
reasonable? While the situation is far too complexd:\work\kindle\holdem\308.png @@ to be proven directly, it probably does not for
several reasons. They are discussed below.

1. Since the button only risked 3.5 big blinds by
calling preflop, hefll expect to win back a large
portion of his preflop call if the expected value
of his weakest hands on the flop is at least 2 big
blinds. Since he often gets the opportunity to
make a profitable bluff even if he flops a hand

preflop call much cheaper than it would other-

2. All the hands in the buttonfs preflop calling

hands or draws on the flop. In other words,
itfs a worst case scenario for our opponent to
have to fold to our flop bet or bluff if we check.
Sometimes his weakest preflop calling hands
are going to flop the nuts or a hand which can
make an excellent bluff raise.

3. Even our opponentfs weakest bluffs on the
flop will usually have a reasonable amount
of equity against our check-calling range. For

position is particularly valuable and/or his range
is much stronger than ours. In addition, on flop
textures where he can make highly profitable
bets with any two cards, we should expect him to

he makes a mistake by not betting the flop.

Next, letfs continue with the same assumptions
from the previous example except we'll fold 70

expectation to at least 3.8 big blinds.

Check-raising is usually the superior line on board

a single street for value and there are many bluffs
in his flop betting range which can improve to the
best hand on the turn. This usually occurs on the

Nevertheless, perhaps the biggest risk with check-

is we'll often get outdrawn or be unable to check-
raise on the turn even if we still have the best
hand. For instance, if we check-call a set on the

us on the turn or river a fair amount of time. In
addition, since itfs usually impossible for us to

opponent will rarely if ever be confused as to
whether hefs bluffing or value betting against our
specific hand, and this allows him to play effectively
against us.

We can model this situation using the same
formula we used to estimate our value betting
to bluffing ratio on the flop. Whereas before, we
assumed the bettorfs value bets and bluffs had 80
and 20 percent equity respectively, these estimates
are not accurate for this situation. Sevens have
significantly less than 20 percent equity when
behind, and less than 80 percent equity when
ahead.

When our opponent has two overcards, such as
the KvQ ‘, his bluff will have around 28 percent
equity. Likewise, when he bets a pair of tens or
better, hefll usually have around 88 percent equity.
Although hefll have a few very weak and very
strong hands in his range on the flop, most of
the hands in his betting range will have around
either 28 or 88 percent equity. Using the same
assumptions from gPart Five: Whether to Bet or
Check in Position,h starting on page 141, which
required 34.3 percent of our flop bets to be able to
value bet the turn and the river, we can estimated:\work\kindle\holdem\330.png @@ what fraction of our opponentfs bets on the flop

(0.6)(X) = 0.063 >
X= 0.105

The model suggests that since our opponentfs
value bets and bluffs both have so much equity, he
needs only 10.5 percent of his flop bets to be value
bets! (And even if he never checks his value bets will
easily surpass that percentage.) While our previous
assumptions are not perfect, especially since our
opponent won't always bet the winning hand on
the turn and river, he also has the advantage of
position which we were unable to take into account
(but which is significant on this flop texture).

This model showcases why check-calling a
vulnerable pocket pair on the flop is often a weak
play despite the hand having so much equity.

That is, a pocket pair will almost never improve to
beat hands in our opponent's value betting range,
but will be outdrawn frequently by his bluffs. In
addition, since there are still multiple streets left

to act, our opponent has several opportunities

to strengthen his range by giving up some of his
bluffs while continuing to value bet all of his strong
hands. Remember, just because a hand has a lot ofd:\work\kindle\holdem\331.png @@ equity does not imply it has a high expected value,
and we must be able to fold high equity hands on
the flop when the situation calls for it.

Weak players often get confused with this concept,
and canft fathom how itfs possible to need to fold
a hand with over 50 percent equity when getting
such a good price. But consistently calling with
weak made hands on the flop is often an especially
problematic leak because these holdings continue
to be difficult to play on the turn and river. In other
words, check-calling with too weak of a made hand
on the flop is a great example of a spot where a small
mistake will often be compounded to a larger and
more expensive mistake on the turn and river.d:\work\kindle\holdem\332.png @@ Donk Betting from
the Blinds

Since the big blind preflop cold calling range is
condensed and position is valuable, we'll often
have to check our entire range on the flop. This is
true even if our range has more equity than our
opponent's.

Here's an example. Our opponent opens on the
button and we call in the big blind using the preflop
ranges from gPart Two: Preflop Play.h If the flop

comes the

typical player. However, despite our range having
more equity and position not being particularly
valuable on this board texture, wefll still likely want

to check our entire range.

The reason why donk betting isnft effective here is
that we have few hands in our range stronger than
king-jack, and as such, the majority of our range isd:\work\kindle\holdem\333.png @@ unable to effectively get more than two streets of
value by betting. In addition, check-calling is not
risky since our opponent is unlikely to outdraw us
when we hold a hand like theK‘7‘.

In other words, just because our range has more
equity than our opponent's, it does not imply we
should have a flop donk betting range. That is, we
must pay attention to how our equity is distributed
among hands in our range, and unless some of
them are very strong, donk betting will not be
effective. More specifically, if our value bets on
the flop are too weak, our opponent will be able to
frequently raise and turn our value hands into bluff
catchers. In addition, even if he does defend by flat
calling against our weak flop bets, itfs unlikely we'll
win at showdown. Thatfs because he won't need
to call down very often because he can defend so
aggressively by raising.

In general, donk betting from the blinds will often
be effective on board textures where we have off
suit two pair combinations and our range has more
equity. Thatfs because the possibility of two pair
hands adda significant amount of equity to our
range and are strong enough to bet on the flop with
the intention of betting all three streets for value.
In addition, if we check our entire range on thesed:\work\kindle\holdem\334.png @@ board textures, our checking range will likely be too
strong and our opponent can exploit us by rarely
betting the flop.

have 9 combinations of two pair since we would
call preflop with king-queen off suit. Furthermore,
if our opponent raises our donk bet, we can 3-bet
some of our very strong hands as well as some
draws and bluffs, so we donft always have to defend
by calling. Lastly, if we never donk bet, a skilled
opponent will be reluctant to bet the flop as he'll

Major Parameters
of Flop Play

We've covered a lot of ground so far, so itfd be
wise to quickly review the major parameters, or
guidelines, previously discussed for flop play.
Although this is all review, seeing the most
important formulas on the same few pages should
help with visualizing exactly what the models are
suggesting.

Parameter No. 1: Minimum Required
Defending Frequency

Example Formula:
minimum defending frequency = pot size / (bet - size + pot - size)

Application: This formula should be used whenever
we desire to prevent our opponent from being able
to profitably bet or raise with any two cards. If
however he has already taken a risk to maybe get
the chance to bluff, allowing him to profitably bet
any two cards is not usually a problem.d:\work\kindle\holdem\336.png @@ For instance, if we bet the flop and our opponent
calls in position, then this formula should not
usually be applied after we check the turn. Our
opponent risked money on the flop and will not
always get this opportunity to make a profitable
bluff.

But our opponent should never be able to
profitably bluff with any two cards when facing a
bet or raise since if he can hefll never fold. As such,
this formula always must be applied when betting
or raising.

Parameter No. 2: Required Felting Range
When Facing a Bet on All Three Streets

Example Formula: If we are out of position and bet 75
percent of the pot on the flop, turn, and river, our
opponent should defend at minimum 18.7 percent
of his range if he only defends by calling.

(flop calling frequency ) (turn calling frequency )
(river calling frequency ) =
0.187 = (0.57) (0.57) (0.57)

Application: This formula determines how strong our
opponentfs river calling range will be if he faces a
bet on all three streets and calls enough to prevent
us from being able to profitably bluff with any twod:\work\kindle\holdem\337.png @@ cards. A near identical formula can be used as well
when facing a flop raise, turn bet, and river bet.

Although hands not strong enough to value bet all
three streets can still be value bet on the flop, rather
than other streets, this is usually only justified if
betting makes high equity hands fold. Also, itfs
especially difficult to bet only a single street for
value on the flop or bet only two streets for value
when out of position since both these lines give
our opponent the opportunity to bet on the river
against a weak range.

Parameter No. 3: The Bluffing to Value

Betting Ratio

Example Formula: If we have a perfectly polarized range
on the flop and can only bet 75 percent of the pot
on each street, we should bet the turn 70 percent of
the time after betting the flop, the river 70 percent
of the time after betting the turn, and 70 percent

of our river bets should be value bets. From these
frequencies, we can derive what percentage of our
flop bets must be value bets.

(turn betting frequency)(river betting frequency)
(percent of river bets which are value bets)

(0.70) (0.70) (0.70) = 0.343d:\work\kindle\holdem\338.png @@ In addition, we can estimate what percentage

of our flop bets should be value bets if our value
bets and bluffs have 80 and 20 percent equity
respectively. Given the assumptions discussed
previously in gPart Five: Whether to Bet or Check in
Position,h only 23.9 percent of our flop bets need to
be value bets.

(0.8) (X)+(0.2)0  X) = 0.343 >

X = 0.239
Application: These formulas can be used to determine
our bluffing to value betting ratio based on our
bet size, the number of streets remaining, and the
equity of our bluffs and value bets. In addition,
there are other important factors, such as the value
of position, each playerfs ability to realize their
equity, and how likely the best hand is to be bet on
all three streets, which must be kept in mind as well
even if our model cannot directly take them into
account.

Parameter No. 4: Required Out of Position

Betting and Check-Defending Frequencies

Example Formula: The following formula can be used
to determine the minimum expected value of our
opponentfs weakest hand on the flop.

minimum EV of opponentfs hand =d:\work\kindle\holdem\339.png @@ (flop checking frequency)[(pot size)(folding
frequency)  (bet size)(defending frequency)]

For example, suppose the pot is 8 big blinds and
whenever a player bets they will bet 6 big blinds. If
we check the flop 60 percent of the time and defend
45 percent of our checks, the minimum expected
value of the opponentfs weakest hand will be

1.02 = (0.6)[(8)(1 - 0.45)  (6)(0.45)]
Application: This formula illustrates how we must
use some combination of betting, check-calling,
and check-raising to keep the expected value of our
opponentfs air hands reasonably low on the flop.

If the expected value is too high, he will be able to

profitably call preflop with hands which otherwise
should be folded.

This is perhaps the hardest and most delicate
parameter to apply since balancing multiple ranges
out of position on the flop is difficult. Furthermore,
on board textures where our range is weak, we
should emphasize check-calling and check-raising
with our strong hands. However, if our range is
strong, betting should be emphasized.d:\work\kindle\holdem\340.png @@ Example of Balancing

opponentfs weakest hands on the flop is at least
0.74 big blinds. If this seems too profitable, aces as
well as some additional bluffs can be check-raised
instead of bet. This will lower the expected value of
our opponentfs weakest hands since his bluffs will

fail more frequently.

In addition, notice there are 3 bluffs in our
betting range for every 2 value bets. This seems
reasonable, especially since tens we recounted
as value bets despite the fact that they clearly
cannot be bet for value on all three streets. Also,
position is reasonably valuable on this flop texture,
so although bluffing a bit more aggressively may
be possible, itfs unlikely we can bluff much more
frequently than we currently are and still remain
reasonably balanced.

Lastly, by now it should be apparent that ranges
are complex and dynamic enough on the flop that
hands cannot always be easily classified as value
bets, bluffs, or draws. Thatfs because there are still
two additional cards to come, and hands are often
bet on the flop for multiple reasons  to make high
equity hands fold and get value from worse hands.
Nevertheless, itfs still important to have some idead:\work\kindle\holdem\343.png @@ of what ratio of value bets to bluffs is being using on

Playing well when out of position on the flop is
tough, but ultimately thatfs a good thing. Difficult
flop situations occur constantly, and by putting in
the necessary work to really understand flop play
we can gain a significant edge on our opponents.

Itfs especially demanding to play out of position
because betting the flop with the intention of
only betting one or two streets for value is often
ineffective. That is, if we check on the river after
betting the flop and turn, our opponent has the
opportunity to bet and convert many of our hands
into bluff catchers.

We also discussed why our opponent must not
be able to make profitable bluffs with any two
cards without having previously taken a risk.
Although allowing him to frequently make a
slightly profitable flop bet in position is not likely
a problem, we should still check-call and check-
raise aggressively on certain board textures.

More specifically, check-raising and check-calling
are significantly more effective at lowering the
expectation of our opponentfs weak hands on the
flop than betting is.d:\work\kindle\holdem\345.png @@ Lastly, board textures where check-calling is
difficult will usually favor the player in position,

checking the turn and/or river after betting on the
flop. Also, large check-raises are more effective if
several turn cards will greatly improve many hands

Herefs a few specific points which were addressed
in this section of the book:

1. Optimal poker only cares about the current
game state. The previous action is only neces-
sary for assigning hand ranges.

2. Itfs acceptable for our opponent to make
profitable bluffs with the worst hands in his
range provided he previously took a risk and
isnft always guaranteed to get a profitable
bluffing opportunity.

3. Check-raising punishes our opponent for
betting the flop with a weak or marginal hand,
but greatly increases the pot size as well as the
strength of our opponentfs range.

4. Making our opponent fold hands which have

20 to 25 percent equity against our hand ond:\work\kindle\holdem\346.png @@ the flop is significant. If betting makes him
fold many high equity hands, then betting the

. Our opponent will likely bet frequently on the
flop when betting with any two cards is highly
profitable. This encourages us to emphasize
check-calling and check-raising with our
strongest hands. If his flop bets are not very
profitable, hefll likely bet at a lower frequency,
and when this happens, it encourages us to bet
our stronger hands for value.

. Some flop textures are difficult to check-raise
because so many turn cards will either make it
difficult to keep betting for value or put many
stronger hands in our opponentfs range. This
requires us to use a bigger check-raise sizing.

. Figuring out which hands work best as check-

3-Bet Pots on the Flopd:\work\kindle\holdem\348.png @@ 3-Bet Pots on the Flop

Introduction

Almost all players at some point in their poker
career think one of the weakest aspects of their
game is 3-bet pots. This is due to several reasons.
First, 3-bet pots occur less often than single raised
pots so players are less experienced with them.

In addition, most players who donft emphasize
learning poker theory use a trial and error approach
to improving their play, and because of this their
play suffers in spots which occur less frequently.
But this wonft be a problem for us as nearly every
concept previously discussed will also apply to 3-
bet pots.

Next, players are more likely to remember their
misplays in 3-bet pots since the pot is larger and
mistakes are so costly. Thus they are more likely
to steam. However, for most players, itfs easier to
accept losing a large pot if they feel they played the
hand well and simply got unlucky. Hence, our focus
will be on the theoretical aspect of 3-bet pots rather
than tilt control because one advantage of playingd:\work\kindle\holdem\349.png @@ well is we're less likely to make a large mistake and
then go on tilt.

Lastly, 3-bet pots are often difficult to play because
the 3-bettor is usually out of position witha
polarized range while the 3-bet caller is in position
with a condensed range. If wefre the 3-bettor, our
range will be the easier one to play since very strong
and very weak hands are typically easier to play
than marginal strength hands. Yet playing out of
position will often be tough even if our range is
polarized. Likewise, although wefll usually have the
advantage of position if we're the 3-bet caller, our
range will include many medium strength hands,
and itfs often difficult to tell whether calling or
folding with these hands when facing multiple bets
is the best strategy.

In spite of this, itfs important not to approach
3-bet pots with any sort of fear. Although more
money than usual is at stake, this shouldn't be
used as justification for poor play. Optimal poker is
aggressive, and it often requires us to make a large
bluff or call down with a bluff catcher in a 3-bet pot.
We simply must accept the fact that there is a lot
of money at stake and be willing to play large pots
with far from nutted hands.d:\work\kindle\holdem\350.png @@ Bet Sizing as the 3-Bettor

If we 3-bet to 12 big blinds preflop and the original
raiser calls, the pot, on the flop, will be around 25
big blinds. If our range is perfectly polarized, the
optimal bet sizing equation shows we should bet
enough so that the pot doubles on each street.

(starting pot -size) (pot growth rate

= final pot - size

where
25 is the starting pot size,
200 is the final pot size, and
Ris the growth rate.
Therefore, if the pot should increase to 2.00 times
its size on each street, we should bet 0.5 pot-sized
bets on the flop, turn, and river, to get all-in on the

river.

SPS = (2) (bet size) >
