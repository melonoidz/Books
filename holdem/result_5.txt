Right Hands on the Flop

One of the trickier aspects of playing the flop in
position is it can be tempting to recklessly bluff
in situations where betting with any two cards is
profitable. This, however, is problematic, as we need
to check back some weak hands on the flop that
can be used as bluffs on later streets. In addition,
if we never check back a weak hand, our range
will be quite transparent on the turn since our
flop checking range will consist of almost entirely
marginal made hands.

LetÅfs start with analyzing which hands usually
make for good bluffing hands on the flop. First,
when we bet the flop, our opponent will fold his
worst hands in his checking range, and this results
in his range being stronger on the turn. In addition,
we'll often have the opportunity to continue
betting the turn and river, which will result in the
final pot being large and our opponentÅfs felting

on the turn stronger, we want to bluff with hands
which retain their equity well against a strong

is facing a strong or weak range, as it will have
around the same amount of equity either way. More
specifically, the gutshot usually needs to improve to
a straight to make the best hand, and once it does,
it will usually be the nuts and win at showdown no

As mentioned before, a flop bet in position will
usually make our opponent fold the weakest 40
to 50 percent of his flop checking range. Since
these hands fold to a bet, we should be less likely
to bluff with hands that do well against this part
of our opponentÅfs range. In other words, if our
holding does particularly well against hands in our
opponentÅfs check-folding range, we should be more
likely to check back the flop and keep these hands in
his range. In addition, since betting the flop makes
our opponentÅfs range stronger on the turn, we do
not want to bluff with hands which donÅft have the
potential to make strong hands by the river.

Checking back strong hands also may make
sense if there are many turn and river cards which
put almost no strong hands in our range. ThatÅfs

While checking back is risky on board textures
where many turn and river cards can improve
our opponent's hand, it may be worth it if we are
sufficiently rewarded when he overbets weaker

Check-Raise

We also need to make sure we're defending
aggressively enough against our opponent's flop
check-raises, turn bets, and river bets so he cannot
profitably raise or bet with any two cards. The math
for this is nearly exactly the same as described
in the chapter ÅgRequired Hand Strength to Value
Raise a Made Hand,Åh starting on page 120, in ÅgPart
Four: Facing a Flop Bet in Position.Åh In this chapter,
we saw how often our opponent needed to defend
against our flop raises, turn bets, and river bets to
prevent us from profitably raising or betting with
any two cards. The exact same concept is present
here, only now we're the player defending against a
raise or bet.

As we saw previously, if our opponent check-
raises a 6 big blind bet into an 8 big blind pot to 18
big blinds, weÅfll probably want to defend around
half of our flop betting range. ThatÅfs because even
though his flop check-raise is expensive, his bluffs
will also sometimes improve on the turn or river
after we call. Likewise, since our opponentÅfs turnd:\work\kindle\holdem\262.png @@ and river bets will be around 64 percent of the
pot, we'll probably want to call approximately 67
and 63 percent of the time on the turn and river,

If we call our opponent's flop bet 50 percent of the
time, his turn bet 67 percent of the time, and his
river bet 63 percent of the time, then 21 percent of
our flop betting range must call all three streets.

0.21 = (0.50)(0.67)(0.63)

Although there are no new concepts here, we
should notice a few of the important aspects of
calling down against a flop check-raise. First, we
will not need to call down with every hand in our
flop value betting range although it depends on
how strong our value bets on the flop are  itÅfs
likely that 30 to 40 percent of our flop bets were
value hands. Furthermore, in this example, we'll
only call down to the river with 21 percent of our
flop betting range, so many of our flop value bets
will be folded on the turn or river.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that calling on all
three streets with many of our flop value hands
is not necessary, we'll usually have to call our
opponentÅfs flop check-raise with some bluffs in
addition to all our value hands. ThatÅfs because we
need to defend 50 percent of our flop betting ranged:\work\kindle\holdem\263.png @@ against a check-raise, but itÅfs unlikely half of our
betting range consists of value hands or draws.
Therefore, some of the hands that should be used
for defending will be unusually weak. Players often
refer to defending with these hands by calling,

a Ågfloat.Åh And if we never float on the flop, our
opponent will be able to check-raise bluff any two
cards profitably.

Floating with some hands on the flop against our
opponentÅfs check-raise is not usually problematic
for two main reasons. The first is there are still
two streets left, so we'll have the opportunity to
bluff our hand again on the turn and/or river if our
opponent checks and we do not improve. Second,
many bluffs on the flop also have some showdown
value, especially against the opponentÅfs check-raise
bluffs.

HereÅfs an example. The

the turn and river are both blanks, checking ace-

We should also accept that some bluff catchers
will need to be called on all three streets against
an optimal opponent. Although itÅfs admittedly
undesirable to be placed in a break even spot-on the
river after having already invested so much money
into the pot, this is unfortunately unavoidable.
However, itÅfs important to remember that even if
the majority of our range are bluff catchers after our
opponent check-raises and bets multiple streets, he
cannot take this line often and remain balanced.
In other words, our opponent will not have many
hands strong enough to check-raise for value on the
flop, and if he check-raises too frequently, his range
will include too many bluffs.
13 In good games you can get away with avoiding these situations
for the sake of reducing volatility. Just remember that you are costing

yourself some EV.d:\work\kindle\holdem\265.png @@ Furthermore, itÅfs best to emphasize calling with
draws which can improve against our opponentÅfs
value betting range even if they have less equity
against our opponentÅfs entire check-raising range.
Remember, simply having more equity does not
make a hand better, and hands which are able to
make the nuts on the turn and river are particularly
useful to have in our calling range.

However, some mediocre strength hands must
still be called so we can check back and win at
showdown if our opponent checks. If too many
draws and not enough made hands are called, it
often won't be possible to bluff all missed draws
on the turn and/or river if our opponent checks.
Therefore, calling with too many speculative hands
and not enough marginal made hands will cause
problems for our entire range.

Another strategy to occasionally consider is 3-
betting the flop. Flat calling the check-raise requires
us to risk 12 additional big blinds to win the 32
big blinds already in the pot, which is a great
price and requires our opponent to keep betting
at a high frequency. Plus, we are in position and

Out of position flop play is an intimidating topic

each playerÅfs range and to determine whose range is
stronger. This makes even scratching the surface of

Conversely, expert players know how difficult

there are still additional cards to come. This is
true for preflop play as well, but since there are no
community cards, generic preflop strategies can be
memorized and applied with little thought. But on
the flop, since there is no excellent starting point
for determining whether to bet or check when out

and has the initiative. Likewise, the out of position
cold caller should not be afraid to donk bet on flop
textures which favor his range. Nevertheless, sinced:\work\kindle\holdem\282.png @@ these leaks are so prevalent, letÅfs briefly discuss why
this is the case before we attempt to fix them.

One reason why these leaks exist is that many
players realizing it was frequently correct to bet the
flop if they were the preflop raiser overdid it. And
since the preflop raiser would usually bet the flop,
it made little sense for the preflop caller to donk bet
a strong hand out of position because a check-raise
would likely be successful.

So why did always betting seem to work? Imagine
playing in a ten handed game and there are three
other tight players, three loose players, and three
average players. After raising first in from under the
gun, we're more likely to be called by a loose player
with a weak range than a tight player with a strong
range. Therefore, it makes sense for us to usually
bet the flop since our range is likely stronger than
our opponentÅfs.

While this is far from theoretically correct poker,
itÅfs likely a reasonable representation of how the
game was played several years ago (and still largely
is played in a live poker setting). The strategy to
constantly continuation bet the flop in heads up
pots probably showed a profit, especially against
weak players. In other words, this advice most
likely did beat the games of the past.Åg But rules liked:\work\kindle\holdem\283.png @@ this are bad from a theoretical perspective and will
cause us to lose against strong opponents and not

14 Keep in mind that when I say games of the past that no-limit
was hardly ever played as a cash game before 2004. But no-limit
tournaments, which began to be shown on television with the
original World Poker Tour shows in 2003, rekindled interest in an
otherwise dead game.

Another reason players often won't lead as the
preflop cold caller is that itÅfs hard to balance both
a flop betting and checking range when out of
position. In fact, balancing multiple ranges when
out of position is probably the second hardest
aspect of no limit holdÅfem to master (with bet
sizing being the most difficult), and many players
arenÅft willing to put in the time necessary to
develop this skill.

Lastly, it should also come as no surprise that
the players who are able to donk bet as well as
effectively defend their checks as the preflop raiser
are often unwilling to discuss it. ThatÅfs because
mastering this skill is such a valuable weapon that
it makes little sense to encourage other players
to develop it as well. And by the time a player has
mastered this skill, heÅfs probably already at the
stage in his poker career where most of his learningd:\work\kindle\holdem\284.png @@ comes from analyzing his own game rather than
learning directly from others.

Position is on the Flop

Although the exact value of position on the flop
is impossible to quantify, there are some board
textures where being in position is extremely
valuable and others where itÅfs not nearly as
important. This concept can best be illustrated by
first imagining an extreme example.

When trying to figure out what fraction of our
flop bets in position should be for value, we started
out with a simple example where we assumed our
range was perfectly polarized. In this situation, we
would always bet the flop, turn, and river with the
right ratio of value bets and bluffs on each street to
make our opponent indifferent to calling. Since our
range was perfectly polarized, our opponent could
never prevent us from realizing our equity, and
because of this, it made no sense for him to ever bet
with his bluff catchers.

In other words, since our opponent will always
check when we have a perfectly polarized range
(giving us no new information) and neither playerd:\work\kindle\holdem\287.png @@ can improve on free cards, it does not matter who
is in position when one player has a perfectly
polarized range. More specifically, when a playerÅfs
range is perfectly polarized, position has no value.
That is, with a perfectly polarized range, we should
bluff the same amount of hands on the flop, turn,
and river regardless of who is in position.

In reality, no player will ever have a perfectly
polarized range on the flop, but there are situations
where the betting range functions more similarly
toa perfectly polarized range than others. This
occurs when value betting hands are very unlikely
to be outdrawn by weaker hands and bluffs are very
unlikely to improve.

HereÅfs an example. When a player bets on the

3a | Fo
a +
Vv: +:

flop, he will usually be betting a very polarized
range. In addition, players rarely bet hands with
the intention of only betting one or two streets for
value on this board texture (though it does happen),
and itÅfs unlikely the best hand on the flop will be
outdrawn by a weaker hand on the turn or river.
Consequently, if a player check-calls on the flop,d:\work\kindle\holdem\288.png @@ he will almost always check on the turn since the
bettorÅfs range will remain polarized.

Since additional cards are unlikely to result in the
better hand being outdrawn, most players probably
feel reasonably comfortable playing out of position
on the K &3 @3 Åë flop. More specifically, itÅfs easy
to check-call with weak top pair hands and strong
middle pairs since few overcards can come on
the turn or river. In addition, since a player who
check-calls on the flop will almost always check
on the turn, the flop bettor gains no additional
information about his opponentÅfs range.

On the other hand, position is more valuable on
board textures where weaker hands can outdraw
stronger hands on the turn and river. ThatÅfs
because the player in position always gets the
first opportunity to end the action and see an
additional card. This allows him to more effectively
manipulate the size of the pot and realize the equity
of his hands. In other words, position is more
valuable on flop textures where the turn will likely
change the strength of many hands in each playerÅfs
range.

Many board textures, such as when the flop comes
thed:\work\kindle\holdem\289.png @@ v oe &

which greatly favor the player in position, are

well known by weak and strong players alike. On
this flop texture, nearly every bluff has at least

one overcard and some sort of straight draw.

This means even the strongest hands on the flop
are vulnerable to being outdrawn on the turn.
Therefore, the player in position will have a much
easier time realizing the equity of his medium
strength made hands and draws than the player out
of position.

Other board textures where position is
especially valuable are not nearly as well known
since additional cards do not at first appear as
threatening. A common mistake players make is
they assume a dry board texture  a board texture
with few or no possible draws  means allowing
the opponentÅfs bluffs to see free cards is not risky.
The fact that there are usually a few strong hands,
such as sets, on dry board textures which do not
fear giving free cards encourages players to think
this way.d:\work\kindle\holdem\290.png @@ In reality, low board textures tend to greatly
favor the player in position since nearly every
bluff has overcards, and making top pair on the
turn or river will often be good enough to win at
showdown. In other words, itÅfs almost as if hands
with two overcards are draws with 6 outs on low
board textures. Consequently, low board textures
function similarly to wet board textures since the
weakest hands in both the betting and calling range
have a considerable amount of equity.

To illustrate this, imagine we open in the
cutoff and the button calls. If the flop comes the
7@5 24, nearly every turn card will improve
some weak hands in our range and our opponentÅfs
range. That is, around 57 percent of the turn cards
will be overcards, and there are no hands on the flop
which won't have a reasonable amount of equity.

In addition, position is particularly valuable on
the 7@5 #2 flop because itÅfs difficult for us to
bet the flop and turn for value with a marginal
strength hand when out of position. ThatÅfs because
our opponent will have the opportunity to bluff
after the river is checked and our marginal strength
hands will become bluff catchers. This makes
playing medium strength hands such as nines,
eights, and pairs of sevens difficult. However,d:\work\kindle\holdem\291.png @@ check-calling with medium strength hands also

Notice that these are the board textures where

Flop No. 1: Q.& 6 v2 . Position is not particularly

Flop No. 2:9 95  3. This board texture is both low
and wet, so position is extremely valuable. ItÅfs also
difficult to check-call on this flop texture, as the
hands which want to get to showdown without
betting all three streets, such as nines and eights,
are also the same hands which are extremely
vulnerable to being outdrawn by overcards.

Flop No. 3: QJ #6 @. Contrary to what many players
believe, position is not particularly important on
this flop texture. ItÅfs easy to check-call with pairs of
queens and jacks since our opponent will often be
betting hands with little equity which are unlikely
to improve. In addition, the flop can be check-
raised occasionally to prevent our opponent from
recklessly betting.

Flop No. 4: 7 #2 2 @. As previously discussed,
position is more valuable on low and dry board
textures than most players think. Check-calling
with marginal strength made hands is difficult
since they will so frequently be outdrawn on the
turn and the river, but in this spot strong hands can
be slowplayed and check-raised on a later street.d:\work\kindle\holdem\293.png @@ Flop No. 5: 764. This flop texture is an absolute

opponent can aggressively overbet on many turn
and river cards.

Furthermore, the marginal strength hands
which are check-called on the flop will frequently
be outdrawn on later streets. In addition, if our
opponent is overbetting, heÅfll be able bet at a high

Value Betting to
Bluffing Ratio

Previously, we found that betting the flop with
a perfectly polarized range required 34.3 percent
of our flop bets to be value bets if we only bet 75
percent of the pot on all three streets. In addition,
if we could overbet the river, only 30.6 percent of
our flop bets needed to be for value. As previously
discussed, since position has no value when a
player has a perfectly polarized range, the exact
same math will apply regardless of who is in
position as long as we assume our range is perfectly
polarized.

Yet when modeling situations where our betting
range was not perfectly polarized, we had to
make several assumptions which were not true

in general. For instance, even if weÅfre only value
betting very strong hands on the flop, the winning
hand won't always be bet on all three streets. In
addition, our opponent may fold to our turn bet (ord:\work\kindle\holdem\295.png @@ make us fold if he raises), and this prevents us from
always realizing the equity of our bluffs. Again,

the model was not able to accurately take this into
account.

On the other hand, when ranges are not perfectly
polarized, position becomes quite valuable and
our assumptions from previous chapters become
more problematic. Specifically, itÅfs more difficult
to realize the equity of our weak hands when out
of position than when in position since a turn
check does not guaranteed we'll see a river card. In
addition, we won't have the ability to bet the river
if our opponent shows weakness by checking, so
getting thin value with strong but not amazing
hands will often be difficult.

In other words, while the exact value of position
cannot be quantified, itÅfs safe to say that if we
wanted to bet between 2.5 to 3 bluffs for every very
strong hand value bet when in position on the flop,
we should be bluffing less when out of position.
And this brings us to our next rule.

Although position will be more valuable on some
flop textures than others, betting between 2 and
2.5 bluffs for every 1 very strong hand value bet out
of position seems reasonable for most flop textures]d:\work\kindle\holdem\296.png @@ As always, be aware of what assumptions are being
made when applying this general rule of thumb

Furthermore, as previously discussed, we'll
sometimes bet hands on the flop with the intention
of only betting one or two streets for value. This is
done when betting the flop will make some high
equity hands fold. Unlike when in position, itÅfs
difficult to bet only two streets for value when
out of position since our opponent will have an
opportunity to bet after the river is checked. This
situation is difficult to model, but despite its
drawbacks, betting only one or two streets for value

Any Two Cards be

Up until now, weÅfve assumed our opponent should

preflop or when out of position on the flop. This
should intuitively make sense for preflop play since
if our opponent could profitably bluff with any two
cards, he would never fold. Likewise, since being
out of position on the flop is a disadvantage, in
raised pots it made sense to assume our opponent
should not be able to profitably lead with any two
cards on the vast majority of flop textures.

trial and error that betting a weak hand when out
of position has a negative expected value on most
board textures even if it cannot be proven directly.

However, there are situations where a player
should be able to make a profitable bluff even if
his hand has no equity. More specifically, these
situations usually occur after someone had to risk
money to maybe get the opportunity to make a
profitable bluff.

HereÅfs an example. The cutoff opens, we 3-bet in
the small blind to 12 big blinds total, and the cutoff
calls. The flop comes the

opponent has the opportunity to go all in for 50 big
blinds to win a 100 big blind pot. This requires us
to call 66.7 percent of the time in order to prevent
him from being able to profitably bluff with any two
cards.

Yet since we 3-bet preflop, bet the flop, and bet
the turn, our range is very polarized by the river,
and few if any hands will work best as check-calls.
In fact, if we had a marginally strong hand on the
flop, such as the Q #9 @ or a pair of jacks, we would
have likely check-called the flop since allowing our
opponent too see additional cards with his weakest
hands isnÅft particularly risky. In other words, once
we check this river, we'll be check-calling much less
than 66.7 percent of the time.

While allowing our opponent to profitably bluff
with any two cards may at first seem confusing,
itÅfs conceptually similar to when we were betting
with a perfectly polarized range. More specifically,
whenever we bet with a perfectly polarized range,
our opponent always effectively lost, yet whenever
we checked, he effectively won. The same process
occurs when we bet the turn with a very polarizedd:\work\kindle\holdem\300.png @@ range in a 3-bet pot since if we check the river our
opponent will almost always win. That is, heÅfll

Put differently, even if our opponent can make
a profitable river bet after we check, this is not a
problem if he had to risk money on the turn to
maybe get this opportunity. For example, if our
opponent calls with a weak speculative hand on the
turn, such as a gutshot, heÅfll usually lose the money
heÅfs invested when his draw misses and we bet the
river. HeÅfll only occasionally improve to the best
hand or get the opportunity to make a profitable
bluff, and this will not make his turn call overly
profitable.

This brings us to our next rule:

The more profitable our opponent's bluff will be,
the more money he should be required to risk
and/or the rarer it should be for him to get the
opportunity to bluff.

Stated another way, if our opponentÅfs bluff ona
later street will only be slightly profitable, then itÅfs
not problematic if he often gets that opportunity
after only risking little. Yet if our opponentÅfs bluff
will be highly profitable, he must risk more money
