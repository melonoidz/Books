a Raise on a Dry Board

Since calling keeps our opponentÅfs range wider
than raising, when we have a very strong hand
with near 100 percent equity, we'll usually want
to call when facing a bet in position and delay
our raise to a later street. Calling keeps all of our
opponentÅfs bluffs in his range, and we can still be
all-in at showdown by raising the turn or river.
The mathematics for this will be discussed in more
detail throughout the book, but itÅfs important to
acknowledge two concepts now:

1. Since raising is much more expensive than
calling, our opponent will fold a large part of
his betting range to our raise. So when we raise
heÅfll never get the chance to realize the equity
of many of his bluffs.

2. Calling a flop bet and raising a later street will
often require our opponent to put more money
into the pot with his range by the river than
raising the flop will.d:\work\kindle\holdem\203.png @@ The fact that calling rather than raising on some
flop textures results in the average final pot size
being larger seems counter-intuitive and often

percent equity and is facing a flop bet, weÅfll often
be able to raise on the turn or river, and by delaying
the raise, we expect to get more value from our
opponentÅfs bluffs.

This is one of the reasons we rarely want to raise
our strongest hands on dry boards and will instead
only defend by calling. Our opponentÅfs bluffs donÅft
have much equity in these spots and usually require
multiple cards to outdraw us. Therefore, we can
call with our strong hands on very dry boards and
then either raise any turn card or call again and
potentially raise the river.

raise on this flop are sets, and they are so strong that
we can call with them and still comfortably raise

When we do call with our entire defending range,
many weak hands will be included. If our raising
range does not include hands which would work
well as bluff raises, then we should be mostly
calling instead. ThatÅfs because if these hands are
not included in our calls, our range on the turn will
be too strong and our opponentÅfs bluffs will be very
profitable (for him) on the flop.

HereÅfs an example. On the previously mentioned
K#8@3- flop, it becomes correct to call with
hands like the T #9 @ with the runner-runner flush

straight draw, and possibly even a pair, we can call
again and hope to improve on the river and wina

turn or river, our hand will almost always become
an effective bluff.

We do not want to frequently delay our raises

this means the majority of the time we call our
opponentÅfs flop bet, heÅfll likely be able to see both
the turn and river card and fully realize the equity
of his bluffs. Since this is so risky, raising rather
than calling on the flop will usually be the superior

The previous point warrants repeating one more

street (the turn), but also if he can runner-runner

the 8v624 flop and the turn card comes a heart,
our set will no longer be strong enough to raise. So
if our opponent bets, we can only call giving him
the opportunity to outdraw us (on the river) with a
hand like AvJa.

Nevertheless, if slowplaying a strong hand on
a wet board is not part of our strategy, we might
find ourselves especially vulnerable to overbets on
the turn. So when debating whether to slowplay
a strong hand on this type of flop, itÅfs a good idead:\work\kindle\holdem\208.png @@ to take into account how many turn cards will
improve hands in our range. If most turn cards do
put strong hands into our range, our opponent will

HereÅfs an example. If the flop is the QvT #6 and
we call our opponentÅfs bet, nearly every turn card
improves some hands in our range. Any ace, king,
jack, or nine gives us either two pair or straight
possibilities, and queens and tens can give us trips
and have an important removal effects. In fact, the
only cards which donÅft significantly improve some
hands in our range (on the turn) are the offsuit six,
five, four, trey, and deuce which only make up 15
cards for less than one-third of the deck. Therefore,
since some hands in our range will improve on
most turn cards, slowplaying becomes much less
critical on this board.

Finally, keep in mind that the riskier slowplaying a
big hand is, the greater the reward should be. That
is, calling will often be worth the risk on boards
where our opponent will overbet the following
street frequently. And although he will sometimes

heÅfs raising against an already polarized range. And
since his range is so polarized, we'll often defend by
calling and utilizing our positional advantage on
the turn.

When we call, the pot will be 80 big blinds and
each player will have a 60 big blind stack remaining.
How often we need to call our opponentÅfs turn jam

his worse theoretically correct bluff to have. Just as
was the case when calling 5-bet jams preflop, our
opponent is guaranteed to realize the equity of his

range than we otherwise would.

(80)(X)- [60 - (200)(equity of blufts)] (l-X) =0

X is the frequency our opponentÅfs bluff must

Both Calling and Raising

We now have all the necessary tools at our disposal
to play well against a flop bet in position. While
many more hand examples are included in the back
of the book, weÅfll now consider some questions and
answers related to defending against a flop bet.
Question No. 1: How wide do we need to defend so that
our opponent canÅft bet any two cards out of position
profitably?

Answer: The first step in our thought process is
how aggressively to defend to keep our opponent
from being able to profitably bet any two

cards. This can be done quickly in our head for
random bet sizings, but we should be especially
comfortable with the normal bet sizes and
have memorized the corresponding defending
frequencies. We should also be comfortable
with defending very wide on flops where our
opponent bets small and folding more of our
range when he bets large.d:\work\kindle\holdem\215.png @@ Question No. 2: What hands do we want to raise for

value?

Answer: First, we need to figure out if our hand is
strong enough to value raise and will later add
enough bluffs so that our range is reasonably
balanced. ItÅfs usually easier to figure out what
hands to value raise first and then add in the
right amount of bluffs. However, on some tricky
board textures, it may be best to work backwards
and first see what hands are appropriate to bluff
raise and then balance the range with value
raises.

Question No. 3: How many bluffs do I need to raise so

my range will be balanced?

Answer: In general, a good starting point is

to assume two bluff raises for every value

raise on the flop. This will usually get us close
to the correct ratio and we can then adjust

the frequency based on how much equity we
think our value hands and bluff raises have.

If itÅfs our opinion that our bluff raises have
significantly more than 20 percent equity, our
bluffing frequency should probably be a bit
more. Likewise, if we think our bluff raises haved:\work\kindle\holdem\216.png @@ less than 20 percent equity, then bluff a bit less.
Similar logic applies for raising our value hands
ItÅfs also correct to bluff raise on the flop
approximately two hands for every one strong
hand we value raise. In addition, keep in mind
that making sure our value to bluff raising
ratio is balanced is much more important
than making sure weÅfve added enough bluffs
to account for our draws  a few draws
won't drastically impact how many bluffs are
necessary to have in our raising range.
Question No. 4: How many hands do we need to
call in order to make a game theoretically optimal
opponent unable to continuation bet more or less than
the optimal amount?

Answer: This is probably the hardest step since itÅfs
necessary to make sure we're calling around the
right amount of hands and not folding too much
or too little. If the board texture misses our range
and our opponentÅfs range, such as a flop of the

idea of creating a balanced betting range so our
opponent is close to indifferent between calling
and folding his marginal holdings will once again

to Bluffing Ratio

for 3 Streets of Value

Recall that a player with a polarized range is able
to bluff many more hand combinations on the
flop than on the river when making pot sized bets.
ThatÅfs because the same value hands are bet on
each street, but on the river a higher fraction of the
betting range needs to be the value hands to keep
the opponent indifferent to calling. We'll use the
same approach here and make many of the same
assumptions with the only difference being that
the bet sizings which will be used are those more
common than a pot sized bet.

Specifically, many players usually bet around 75
percent of the pot if they think their opponent can
be strong and may be planning on check-raising.
One of the reasons for this is that good players donÅft
usually start overbetting until theyÅfre confident

LetÅfs start with figuring out what fraction of our
flop bets need to be value bets if we plan on betting
75 percent of the pot on each street with a perfectly
polarized range. So by betting this amount on the
river, our opponent will risk 0.75 pot sized bets to
win 1.75 pot sized bets. This requires 70 percent of
our river bets to be value bets.

percentage of our flop bets should be for value.

The next step is to notice if we bet 75 percent of
the pot on the turn, our opponent will once again
be risking 0.75 pot sized bets to win 1.75 pot sized
bets. And just as discussed before, if our turn
betting range is perfectly polarized, this requires
us to bet the river 70 percent of the time with a
balanced range to keep our opponent indifferent
to calling on the turn. ThatÅfs once again because

Again, this is no different than what we did
previously, only now our bets are a bit smaller than
pot sized bets. Furthermore, since we're betting
slightly smaller than before, a bit more of our
bets on each street need to be for value since our
opponent is getting a better price to call.

LetÅfs try another example where we figure out
what fraction of our flop bets should be value bets,d:\work\kindle\holdem\230.png @@ only now assume we're allowed to overbet the river
and have 1.5 pot sized bets remaining. Remember,
although it will be discussed in more detail in
future chapters, overbets occur most frequently on

heÅfs less likely to be strong. In other words, betting
1.5 pot sized bets on the river after making two
smaller bets is often theoretically correct since itÅfs
not until the river that we can comfortably overbet.

Once again, we'll start on the river and work
backwards. By betting 1.5 pot sized bets on the
river, our opponent will risk 1.5 pot sized bets to
win 2.5 pot sized bets. Consequently, since our bet is
now larger and our opponent is getting worse odds

Now, since we still bet the turn for 75 percent of
the pot, our opponent risked 0.75 pot sized bets to
win 1.75 pot sized bets. And just like in the previous
example, this required us to bet the river 70 percent

river as described.

(turn betting frequency ) (river betting frequency)

Notice weÅfre still using the same methodology as
before when betting 75 percent of the pot on each
street. That is, weÅfve worked backwards from the
river to determine what percentage of our flop bets
must be value bets. The only difference is since
we're now overbetting the river, fewer of our river
bets need to be value bets since our opponent is
getting worse odds to call.

Thinking back to the flop raising example in Part
Four, we needed to be able to bet the turn and river
for value with 39 percent of our flop raising range
if our opponent always won once we checked. In
contrast, only 34.3 or 30.6 percent of our flop bets
needed to be for value on the turn and river in
the previous two examples. In other words, weÅfre
allowed to bluff more combinations of hands for
each strong hand we value bet on the flop whend:\work\kindle\holdem\232.png @@ compared to raising on the flop. And this makes
sense since there is more effective stack depth when
betting rather than raising, and bigger bets relative
to the size of the pot allow us to bluff more. Put
another way, when bets are larger our opponent
gets a worse price to call, and this means a larger
fraction of our betting range should be bluffs

to keep him indifferent to calling with his bluff
catchers.

Most if not all of the rules which apply to raising
in position should also be applied to betting
in position. For instance, we can bluff more
aggressively if we can check back bluffs which
improve to marginal hands that can win at
showdown. Conversely, if we turn or river the best
hand but our opponent can bluff and make us fold,
we have to bluff less. Likewise, itÅfs important to take
into account how easy it is for each player to realize
the equity of their weaker hands. We are once again
in position and position is valuable, and this allows
us to bluff aggressively on many flop textures.

LetÅfs now estimate how often we need to be value

have 80 and 20 percent equity, respectively. If the
turn and river must both be bet for value with 34.3

While it intuitively makes sense to think we can

bluff aggressively on the flop in position, having
over four bluffs for every value bet on the flop
seems extreme and counter-intuitive. This is largely
due to the fact that in practice, we won't always
be able to bet all three streets when we have the
winning hand, and we certainly won't be able to
overbet all winning hands on the river. And this

the pot smaller and the opponent'Åfs range wider so
weaker hands can be bet for value.

Once again, letÅfs start with a simple example and
assume we bet 75 percent of the pot on the flop and

0.75 pot sized bets to win 1.75 pot sized bets. Since

we check, this requires us to bet the turn 70 percent

calling on the flop.

In order to find out what percentage of our flop

It should come as no surprise that since one less
round of betting is utilized, a higher value betting

the intention of betting the turn and checking the
river is an extremely common and useful line. By
using this strategy when there are additional cards
to come, our opponent will not be able to cheaply

This is a great spot to bet the flop with the intention

the river. Betting the flop and turn will likely be
effective since we will get value when our opponent
has a pair of eights as well as make him fold some
hands, such as overcards, which could outdraw us.
Yet betting the river will likely be a losing play. Our
opponent will often fold eights and call or raise his
pairs of tens and better.

Strength to Value
Bet the Flop

When our opponent checks to us on the flop, heÅfll
have a relatively weak range (his betting range is
of course stronger) as well as be at a disadvantage
from being out of position. Because of this, on
many board textures, heÅfll not want to defend 60
percent or more of his flop checks against a 0.75
pot-sized bet. In other words, our opponent is
better off to check-fold the flop when the pot is
small rather than calling down with weak holdings.
How aggressively he should defend his checks will
depend both on the strength of each playerÅfs range
as well as how valuable position is on the given flop
texture.

In ÅgPart Six: Out of Position Flop Play,Åfstarting on
page 179, we'll analyze how aggressively the player
out of position should defend his flop checks. For
now, letÅfs start with a simple example and assume

intuitively make sense since he would rather fold

at a higher frequency on the flop when the pot is
smallest than on the turn or river.

As is usually the case, weÅfll need to work
backwards to figure what percentage of our
opponentÅfs flop checking range will call down when
facing a bet on each street. LetÅfs start by noticing
if we bet 75 percent of the pot on the river, we'll be

continue to work backwards and notice if we bet
the turn for 75 percent of the pot, we'll once again
be risking 0.75 pot sized bets to win 1 pot sized bet,

of the time on the river, 57.1 percent of the time
on the turn, and 50 percent of the time on the flop,
these frequencies can be multiplied together to
show that his flop checking range will call down all

likely weaker than it would at first seem. ThatÅfs
because if he bets most of his strong hands on
the flop, then his initial flop checking range will
be quite weak. Consequently, the majority of our
opponentÅfs check-calling range will consist of bluff
catchers. Lastly, he may decide to call a bit more
than 57.1 percent of the time on the turn since our
bluffs can improve on the river, and if he does, his
felting range will be even weaker.d:\work\kindle\holdem\244.png @@ Likewise, if sticking with our previous

to checking. First, it makes our opponentÅfs

a bluff catcher. To make matters worse, these
bluff catching hands are often medium pair

While there are significant drawbacks to betting
the flop with a hand that will only be able to bet

our opponent to recklessly bluff the turn after
showing weakness. One leak many new players
