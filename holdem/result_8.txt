Moreover, our opponent will know that if we

impossible to bet a balanced range.

Imagine on the above flop we decide to instead

on the turn, check again with many weak hands

ItÅfs often tricky to tell whether a hand should
be bluffed on the flop or checked back with the
intention to bluff a later street. As previously
mentioned, we should emphasize checking with
hands which will improve on the same turn cards
as hands in our opponentÅfs check-folding range.
This is often true even if betting the flop would
make some better hands fold. ThatÅfs because a bet
on a later street will likely make these holdings fold
anyway.

HereÅfs an example. We call a middle position open
on the button with the A ÅëK and the flop comes
theJ v8v64@. Checking back ace-king on this flop
is likely best since our opponent may have an ace-
queen or king-queen hand heÅfs planning on check-
folding to a bet. Notice that checking allows us
to make top pair on the turn and get value from
our opponent when he makes the same pair with
a worse kicker. Additionally, if he checked a weak
pocket pair on the flop, he'll likely check the hand
again on the turn and the river. This gives us thed:\work\kindle\holdem\403.png @@ opportunity to bluff on a later street and make him

In contrast, betting is best if we have a hand like

its equity very well as a bet since it has the potential
to runner-runner a straight or flush. Furthermore,
itÅfs now desirable to bet the flop and make our
opponent fold something like king-queen.

Lastly, itÅfs important to note our range will often
be capped on the turn when we bet after checking
the flop. This means whenever our opponent check-
raises, our hand at best will be a bluff catcher.
However, this is not a problem. Our opponent can
check-raise only so often and remain balanced, and
itÅfs risky for him to check the turn with a strong
hand. And when he does check-raise, we simply
must call down often enough so he cannot bluff too
aggressively. This is true even if the expectation of
calling is zero with every bluff catcher in our range.

Facing a Turn Bet

After Calling a Flop Check-Raise

After a flop check-raise, our opponent will usually
bet around 25 big blinds on the turn into a 44 big
blind pot. This needs to succeed 36.2 percent of thed:\work\kindle\holdem\404.png @@ time for him to make an immediate profit, so on the
turn, we must defend at least 63.8 percent of our
range to prevent him from being able to profitably
bet any two cards. Nevertheless, whether calling

or raising is best depends on how risky it is to give
additional cards to hands in our opponent's bet-
folding range.

Since the price to call on the turn is 25 big blinds to
win 69 big blinds, our opponent must bet the river
at a high frequency to make us indifferent to calling
with our bluff catchers. This makes calling with our
strong hands tempting as his range should be very
polarized and heÅfll likely bet all of his strong hands
on the river in addition to some bluffs.

However, after our opponent bets the turn,
because stack sizes are shallow relative to the size
of the pot, going all-in is also a reasonable option.
This is true even though his range should be
polarized and we have position. When we go all-
in, weÅfre guaranteed to realize our handÅfs equity,
and jamming prevents our opponent from getting
to see the river and realize the equity of his bluffs.
This is especially significant since a skilled player
will check-raise bluff on the flop with hands, such
as gutshots or hands with three to a flush and three
toa straight, which retain their equity well. Manyd:\work\kindle\holdem\405.png @@ of these bluffs will have several outs to the nuts on
the river. So jamming the turn usually makes our
opponent fold his weaker draws and make only
slightly profitable calls with his stronger draws.

As previously shown, whenever our bluff jam is
called, we expect to, on average, get 2 big blinds
back for every percent of equity our hand has. This
is the same concept as discussed when making 5-
bet bluffs preflop and jamming turns in 3-bet pots,
and it makes our bluffs much cheaper in the long
run than they would otherwise be.

For instance, suppose the weakest bluff in our
range on a given board texture has 20 percent
equity against our opponentÅfs calling range. This is
around, on the turn, how much equity flush draws
and open-ended straight draws have against most
calling ranges. So if we go all-in for a 79 big blind
bet, we'll only lose on average 38.7 big blinds when
called.

38.7 = (0.20)(201.5)79
where
201.5 is the pot size, and
79 is the size of the turn raise.

So if our opponent wants to make us indifferent

to jamming the turn with flush draws and straight
draws, heÅfll need to call with approximately 64.1
percent of his turn betting range. This usually is
not a problem so long as heÅfs willing to call with
some draws (provided these draws can sometimes
win unimproved), as 64.1 percent of his turn
betting range won't be value bets. Furthermore,
it may simply be the case that in some spots itÅfs
possible for us to profitably jam the turn with open
ended straight draws and flush draws because
our opponent canÅft quite defend 64.1 percent
of the time. Nevertheless, these hands are not
bluff catchers, and being able to make a slightly
profitable bluff with a draw after taking a risk does
not necessarily mean our opponent made a mistake
or is being exploited.d:\work\kindle\holdem\407.png @@ ItÅfs also difficult to say whether or not jamming or
calling the turn ultimately requires our opponent
to felt a wider range. ThatÅfs because his turn betting
range won't be perfectly polarized, and since
he can river a marginal strength hand, we canÅft
conclude exactly how often he should bet the river.
In addition, the more equity our bluffs have on the
turn, the more frequently our opponent needs to
call our turn jam. That is, high equity bluffs donÅft
need to succeed very often to be profitable, so if
our bluffs have a lot of equity, our opponent must
frequently call to keep us indifferent to jamming
and folding.

But perhaps the most important factor for
determining whether to jam or call the turn with
a strong hand is if jamming makes our opponent
fold many high equity hands. For example, in
the previous example we assumed he called 64.1
percent of the time and folded 35.9 percent of the
time. If we hold a strong hand which is vulnerable
to being outdrawn by hands in the bottom 35.9
percent of our opponentÅfs turn betting range,
then jamming will almost certainly be better than
calling. This is true despite the fact that jamming

river. Therefore, itÅfs best to require him to either
fold or commit his entire stack with his draw, and
by raising now we also ensure we get value from
our opponentÅfs smaller sets and two pairs.

Lastly, itÅfs important to note having a capped range
rarely matters when there are few streets left to
act and little stack depth. (In the above example,
this will happen when we only call the turn bet.)
Capped ranges are usually problematic because our

our opponent can only go all-in for 0.57 pot sized
bets. Since he canÅft overbet the river, calling witha
strong hand on the turn will likely be less profitable
than raising. This often results in the best hand in
our river range being a bluff catcher, and when this
happens, we should call often enough to keep him
indifferent to bluffing (even if the expectation for

our call is zero).

the strength of either playerÅfs range, our opponentÅfs

In addition, contrary to what the vast majority of

Furthermore, if our opponent does have a strong

value raising ratio. Notice weÅfre bluff-raising with
half of our pair of ten combinations and calling
with the other half. If we were to bluff raise them

expected value of raising and calling with tens is
approximately the same. If one line has a higher
expected value, then that line should always be
taken. However, taking multiple lines with the

happens here.

It should also come as no surprise that since the

Excellent positional turn play requires us to

turn and need to consider large or small bets. If

medium strength hands. But when his range is

our opponent pays to call our flop bet determines
what betting, check-calling, and check-raising

Previously, we focused on combating our
opponentÅfs flop calls by betting the turn and the
river. This was done because situations where the
betor has a perfectly polarized range are easy to
model allowing for new concepts to be explained
clearly. But in reality, we'll also need to defend
against our opponentÅfs flop calls by check-calling
and check-raising on the turn rather than just
betting.

HereÅfs a simple example. We bet 6 big blinds into
an 8 big blind pot on the flop and our opponent
calls with a hand with no equity. Furthermore, letÅfs
assume he will always bet 15 big blinds on the turn
if we check since his hand never has any showdown
value (so the only way for him to win is by bluffing).
When he does this, what line we take on the turn
will determine how much money he'll win or lose
overall from calling on the flop.d:\work\kindle\holdem\425.png @@ 1. Check-folding the turn results in our oppo-

2. Assuming our opponent will fold his zero
equity hand when we bet the turn, betting
causes him to lose the 6 big blinds he risked on
the flop.

3. Check-calling and check-raising cause our
opponent to lose both the 6 big blinds he risked
from calling the flop as well as his 15 big blind
turn bet, a total of 21 big blinds in all.

Therefore, we must not check-fold the turn at such
a high frequency that our opponent can profitably
call on the flop with any two cards intending
to bluff the following street. Furthermore, the
previously mentioned values can be used in the
inequality below to show some combination of
betting, check-raising, and check-calling on the
turn is necessary to make our opponent unable to
profitably call with the worst hand in his flopping

range.

(Tum check - folding frequency) (14) + (tum betting frequency) (-6)

+ (tur check - defending frequency) (-21) <0d:\work\kindle\holdem\426.png @@ Notice this is an inequality rather than an
equation. ThatÅfs because the expected value (for our
opponent)of calling the worst hand in his flopping
range must be less than or equal to zero or else he'll
never fold on the flop. In other words, although we
donÅft know the expected value for calling the worst
hand in our opponentÅfs flopping range, it must be
less than or equal to zero or else he should never
fold.

In addition, our example assumes our opponent
loses on average the maximum amount possible
when we bet the turn, check-call, or check-raise.

In reality, he won't, on average, lose 6 big blinds
when our flop bet is called and we bet the turn since
sometimes heÅfll improve on the turn and be able to
profitably raise or call.

Likewise, when we check-call on the turn, our
opponentÅfs hand will usually have some equity
or may get the opportunity to profitably bluff on
the river. This further stresses why our opponent
should, if we are playing correctly, expect to lose
money if he ever calls the flop with a hand with no
equity. Our turn frequencies should be designed
to make the worst theoretically correct call in his

range close to break even, and since these handsd:\work\kindle\holdem\427.png @@ have equity, if he calls with a hand with no equity, it
should clearly be a losing play.

Additionally, although our turn frequencies
should change for different flop textures, if we bet
properly, our opponent probably should fold the
weakest hands in his range to abet. Put differently,
if our flop betting range is so weak relative to our
opponentÅfs range that he should never fold, then we
almost certainly shouldn't have bet the flop to begin
with.

Although this inequality cannot be used to find
the theoretically correct turn betting, check-calling,
and check-raising frequencies, it can be used to
tell if a combination of frequencies is wrong. For
instance, suppose we bet the turn 50 percent of
the time, check-call and check-raise 5 percent of
the time combined, and check-fold the remaining
45 percent. When using these frequencies, the
expected value of our opponentÅfs flop call with the
worst hand in his flopping range is at least 2.25 big
blinds.

2.25 = (0.45)(14) + (0.50)(6) + (0.05)(-21)

0.50 is the turn betting frequency, and
0.05 is the turn check-defending frequencyd:\work\kindle\holdem\428.png @@ ItÅfs important to remember that 2.25 big blinds is
the minimum amount our opponent expects to win
on average with his flop call since even the worst
hand in his flopping range will have some equity.
And in this example, our opponent should never
fold on the flop since every hand can be profitably
called.

Also notice that betting the turn only 50 percent
of the time and rarely check-calling or check-
raising is easily exploitable, and these frequencies
arenÅft as unrealistic as they may at first seem. This
is especially true on certain flop textures. ThatÅfs
because many players recklessly bet the flop, and
as a result have a weak turn range. And since their
turn range is weak, they end up check-folding at
a high frequency which is especially problematic
if they aren't frequently check-calling or check-
raising the turn (and many players aren't). In fact,
there are many winning players who bet the flop so
often that itÅfs profitable to call with any two cards
on certain flop textures hoping for the opportunity
to bluff the turn.

HereÅfs an example. A poor player will usually
continuation bet on thed:\work\kindle\holdem\429.png @@ flop. HeÅfll usually value bet with all his strong
hands and bluff all his weak ones, and medium
strength made hands such as weak aces and strong
middle pairs are check-called. When he does this,
his range will be very unbalanced on the turn. He'll
have trouble betting and defending his checks
aggressively enough to prevent his opponent from
profitably calling on the flop with any two cards.

Even if a player who recklessly bets on a the
A&7@2 flop also bets all of his premium hands,
these holdings are very limited in quantity. There
simply wonÅft be many strong hands on the turn
relative to the amount of weak hands bluffed on the
flop. Additionally, since the flop is so dry, there will
usually be few possible straight or flush draws on
the turn, and there will never be any overcards. So
for these reasons, players who bet too frequently on
the flop will often find betting the turn aggressively
on dry boards especially troublesome.

Additionally, if a player bets the flop aggressively
but check calls all of his medium strength hands,
heÅfll often struggle to defend enough of his turnd:\work\kindle\holdem\430.png @@ checks. ThatÅfs because there will be few or no hands
in his range on the turn which work well as check-
calls. This results in him check-folding the turn at a
high frequency, and because of this, floating on the
flop against such a player is exceptionally effective.

Consequently, when using computer software
to analyze your play, itÅfs a good idea to be aware
of your turn betting frequency, check-calling
frequency, and check-raising frequency after
betting the flop. If your opponent can on average
profitably call on the flop with any two cards, this
is a massive leak that an astute player can easily
exploit. In addition, even if your opponent will on
average lose a small amount of money if he floats
the flop with a zero equity hand, this still suggests
our turn frequencies are not nearly aggressive
enough. Therefore, if you find you have this leak,
and many players do, make an effort to bet less
frequently on the flop and play more aggressively
on the turn. Also, look for specific board textures
where you think you may be playing poorly.

ItÅfs also worth repeating once more that while we
can prove certain combinations of turn betting,
check-calling, and check-raising frequencies are
easily exploitable, we canÅft solve for the optimal
frequencies. Furthermore, we should note thatd:\work\kindle\holdem\431.png @@ check-calling and check-raising the turn are

we check-call or check-raise. In other words, if weÅfre
concerned the expected value of our opponentÅfs
flop calls with weak hands is too high, one way to
lower this value is to more aggressively check-call

Lastly, notice itÅfs riskier for our opponent to call
our flop bet with a hand which has no showdown
value than a bluff catcher. ThatÅfs because bluff
catchers can check back the turn and the river
to win at showdown without risking any more

reason, calling on the flop with hands that have no

Out of Position

on the Turn

On the turn, one of the biggest disadvantages to
being out of position is that draws play quite poorly
as check-calls. This is largely due to the fact that
after check-calling on the turn, we won't get the
opportunity to see if our opponent checks before
deciding whether to bluff on the river if our draw
misses. Consequently, this often makes it difficult,
if not impossible, to profitably check-call with weak
draws on the turn.

So the real question will often not be whether
check-calling with a draw is profitable, but rather if
check-calling is more profitable than either check-
raising or betting. Remember, hands with little
showdown value which retain their equity well
as bets or raises usually make the best bluffing
hands, and draws with 8 to 11 outs on the turn
often fit this description perfectly. The fact that
draws work so well as bluffs is another reason whyd:\work\kindle\holdem\433.png @@ theyÅfre usually bet on the turn rather than check-

Nevertheless, on the turn, it will not always
make sense for us to have a betting range when
out of position. ThatÅfs because if we check-called
on the flop, our range will be condensed and our
opponentÅfs polarized. Hence, for this reason, we'll
not always have the option of betting our draws (on
the turn) in a balanced range, and will instead have
to check-call, check-raise, or check-fold.

For analyzing the profitability of check-calling
the turn with a draw, letÅfs assume it has 20 percent
equity and all our outs are clean  nine out flush
draws usually have around 20 percent equity and
eight out open ended straight draws have around
18 percent equity. If our opponent bets 15 big
blinds into a 20 big blind pot, by calling we risk 15
big blinds to win the 35 big blinds already in the
pot plus any additional implied odds.12 Since we'll
lose 15 big blinds 80 percent of the time and win
20 percent of the time, an equation can be used to
solve for how many big blinds we'll need to win on

Small offhand calculations like this are useful
to make while playing, especially when trying
to figure out if calling with a draw is profitable.
And with our above assumptions, we must win
on average at least 60 big blinds to justify check-
calling. Another way to look at this is since the
pot size after our opponent bets is already 35 big
blinds, we need to win on the river, on average, an
extra 25 big blinds for our turn call to have positive
expectation.

However, this information cannot be used directly
to figure out how often our opponent will bet the
river or what bet sizing heÅfll use. ThatÅfs because

If our flop bet was called, we'll usually havea

our opponent's range should consist of depends on
the board texture and whether he slowplayed many
strong hands on the flop. If he has few strong hands

so even if our opponent does have a very strong
holding, heÅfs still limited on how much he can win.

Yet even when we have an overbetting range,
strong hands which may be beat or splitting should
bet smaller. For instance, it would not make sense
to overbet jacks on the Kw T v7 #5 @ board. More
specifically, betting smaller requires our opponent
to keep calling with weaker hands, such as a pair
of tens or a weak draw, that would fold to a large
bet. In addition, if he has us beat, we'll usually lose
less money since heÅfll be unlikely to raise with
a capped range. However, itÅfs crucial we also bet

One option is to make a medium sized bet on the
flop and then to bet smaller on favorable turn and
river cards. Betting the flop a bit larger is ideal
because we want to encourage our opponent to
fold some high equity hands such as theAÅëJ@

have tainted outs against our betting range. Yet

beat. Lastly, if he is unlikely to raise our turn bets
aggressively with his strong hands, we'll lose less

opponent bet larger.

While you might think betting small on blank

overbetting a pair of queens may be an excellent

spot.

opponent likely just called with sets on the flop

and bluffs. This is significant because if we have
a straight on the turn and our opponent has a set,
heÅfll likely end up raising and committing his stack

our opponent decides to go all-in, heÅfll forfeit his
positional advantage, whereas before, when we
raised in position, he could go all-in and destroy our
positional advantage. Consequently, this allows us

mostly defend by calling. And since our turn check-
raises are slightly larger than our positional raises
and we donÅft have the advantage of position, we'll
usually want 50 to 60 percent of our check-raises to
be for value.

Despite the similarities between raising in position
and out of position, there are several key differences
which should be taken into account. The first
key difference is when out of position, weÅfre not

gives our opponent a great price to call and lets
him frequently play the river in position. Yet on the
other hand, a large check-raise makes it difficult for
us to fold if our opponent jams since we're getting
