let us win with ace-queen unimproved, he may give
us a free card if we check it on the turn. Since ace-
queen makes up so much of our range, it makes
sense to bet some and check others. In addition, we
should likely check-call and/or check-raise some
strong hands on the turn to protect our checking
range since our opponent will be able to recklessly
bet if our range is capped at nines, and aces works
well in this regard.

Notice that check-calling with ace-queen isnÅft as
unreasonable on the turn as it would first seem. Our
opponent will likely check back his ace-king hands,
and bet with his hands which have little showdown
value such as KQs, KJs, KTs, etc. So itÅfs possible ace-
queen is the best hand after check-calling, and if it

Analysis: We turn many top pair hands, but as

previously shown, our opponentÅfs range is quite

strong. So recklessly betting top pair hands will

result in us getting very little value when called

as well as make us vulnerable to raises. Therefore,

check-calling with our top pair hands is likely best.

One useful rule to remember when out of position
is, ÅgIf you think itÅfs close between betting and
checking, consider betting smaller.Åh ThatÅfs because
asmall bet does not re-open up the betting like a bet
in position does. So, for instance, making a large bet
on a pair of queens may make our opponentÅfs range
too strong as well as punish us more severely when
facing a raise, yet checking allows him to freely
realize the equity of his ace-king hands. Hence, in
this case, it may be best to make a small bet with
queens, and if we do bet them on the turn, weÅfll
likely need to check-call rather than value bet on
the river.

Analysis: This is an extremely difficult board to
balance out of position ranges since many hands
which cannot get three streets of value (such as tens
and nines) are also the hands most vulnerable to
being outdrawn by the overcards in our opponentÅfs
range that will often fold to a flop bet. ItÅfs the
perfect example of a board players consider ÅgdryÅh

yet being in position is massively advantageous.d:\work\kindle\holdem\672.png @@ Since I previously assumed the player in position
will call flop bets with ace-king and ace-queen, I
chose to check-call with jacks since betting didnÅft
make many high equity hands fold. But IÅfm not
sure this is correct, as both betting and check-
calling jacks is clearly profitable. I also chose to
check-call aces since this hand isnÅft vulnerable
to being outdrawn on the turn and check-calling
keeps dominated hands in our opponentÅfs range.
Furthermore, note that I included sevens in the
value betting range, but my plan is to check-call
with it on almost all turn cards.

The fact that our opponent may bet the flop with
the intention of checking the turn and river with
a marginal made hand makes check-raising a
reasonable option on such a dry board texture. I
chose to check-raise A8s, T8s, and 66 for this reason
despite them being strong enough to delay the
check-raise until the following street.

We won't be able to bluff on later streets with all
our overcard hands which check-called the flop,
but thatÅfs fine. Ace-king especially can regularly
win at showdown and bluffing won't consistently
make better hands fold, and other hands with less
showdown value can be bluffed on later streets if

they donÅft improve.d:\work\kindle\holdem\673.png @@ Lastly, since giving free cards to our checking
range is risky, note if we are not aggressively
defending our checks, our opponent will bet at a

this is almost certainly far from theoretically
correct.

This is a relatively easy board to play out of

ItÅfs also a board texture where high flop, turn, and

Furthermore, the only very strong hands in our

Also notice if we never check-call any flush draws,
all the hands in our check-calling range will have
showdown value and this makes it difficult to
effectively bluff on later streets (since the same
hands weÅfre bluffing with will likely win by
checking anyway). ItÅfs tempting to only check-call
with marginal strength made hands on the flop
since they work so well in this fashion, but this
results in our range being unbalanced.

Analysis: This turn card didnÅft improve many

hands in our range and ace-seven suited is now
weaker. Because of this, itÅfs difficult to bet the turn
aggressively. Although weÅfd much prefer the turn
card to come a blank which allows us to keep value
betting aggressively as well as bet large, sometimes

we get a less favorable card.

also think ace-queen isnÅft strong enough to value
bet, as our opponent won't call down with many
worse hands and giving free cards isnÅft particularly
risky. Additionally, betting makes our checking
range very weak. Therefore, I think we should just
check-call with ace-queen since this punishes our
opponent for betting the turn too aggressively.

Another thought that crossed my mind is I should
have bet the flop with our A ÅëX # hands. These
hands are able to comfortably check-call on any
turn card and this keeps our opponentÅfs dominated
flush draws in his range. Furthermore, they also do
well when facing a flop raise since they beat bluffs
and have outs to the nuts when behind. When
making ranges, itÅfs important to think back to thed:\work\kindle\holdem\689.png @@ previous street and see if thereÅfs a way your range
can be improved.

Lastly, IÅfm not sure if check-calling tens and
nines will have a positive expectation, especially
in practice. Notice we're check-raising the turn
reasonably often, which encourages our opponent
to bet smaller and gives us a better price on our call,
but in reality, most players will bet too much once
we check. This makes calling worse than it would
otherwise be and further reinforces the fact that
betting A@XÅë hands on the flop and check-calling
on the turn may be best.

Remember, itÅfs impossible to get everything

Analysis: The turn card is unfortunately a blank and
thus puts no strong hands in our range. While itÅfs
easy to think we must have done something wrong
on the previous street, itÅfs important to remember
our opponent cannot bet the turn (much less
overbet) too often or heÅfll be unbalanced. So while
facing a large bet from a balanced opponent is
undesirable, it can only happen occasionally or we
can exploit him by frequently calling.

ItÅfs still quite easy to call a balanced range against a
normal sized bet, and we donÅft need to call with any
made hand worse than king-jack suited (though
calling with a few weaker jacks as well may be fine).

Analysis: Since our range is condensed on the river

and our opponentÅfs range is polarized, it makes no

twelve ace-jack hands in our range.

This hand showcases why itÅfs hard to get three

Analysis: Although many players bet king-queen
on this flop with little thought, itÅfs unlikely our
opponent will call down with worse if we bet all
three streets. ThatÅfs because, on this flop, typical
button calling ranges have king-queen or better
19 percent of the time, so itÅfs unlikely heÅfll have to
call down with many worse hands. Additionally,
itÅfs important we adequately defend our checks
against strong opponents, and check-calling helps
accomplish this.

Since there are two high cards on the flop, itÅfs not
overly difficult to check-call aggressively. Hands
such as queen-ten, ace-jack, and king-jack make
excellent check-calls, and by check-calling with
some flush draws as well, we'll be able to effectively
bluff the river if our opponent checks back the turn.

determining how to divide our flush draws among
our betting, check-calling, and check-raising range.

Analysis: In this spot, there are many important

concepts at play. The first, and perhaps the

most important, is we should strongly consider

overbetting. Many straight and flush draws were

possible on the flop, so itÅfs unlikely our opponent

would slowplay his strong hands. Because of

this, he likely has no raising range on the turn.

Furthermore, our flop betting range was quited:\work\kindle\holdem\697.png @@ polarized, so there are few hands (in our range)
which prefer to bet small.

Also note most of our bluffs have a considerable
amount of equity and will often improve on the
river. Since several of them will likely become value
hands, weÅfre able to bluff a bit more aggressively on
the turn.

Additionally, notice our range includes no medium
strength hands which work particularly well as
check-calls. This encourages our opponent to bet
smaller since we won't frequently be check-calling
and will instead usually either check-fold or check-
raise. Thus, when our opponent bets small, check-
calling tens or nines may be profitable since weÅfre
getting such a good price and he won't usually
be value betting middle pair hands anyway. And
since I donÅft want my check-calling range to be too
transparent, my strategy is to check-call a couple of
ace-queen hands to protect my check-calling range.

Finally, understand we could have bet a few ace-
jack or queen-nine suited type hands on the flop so
we'd have some holdings in our range which work
well as check-calls on blank turns. In retrospect, it
may have been correct to bet a few of these hands
(on the flop) for this very reason. However, on the

Analysis: ItÅfs really amazing how much easier it is to
defend in position than out of position. This is a flop
texture thatÅfs extremely difficult to play well out of
position, but in position, itÅfs quite easy to tell which
hands make reasonable calls, raises, and folds.
ThatÅfs also why when analyzing hand examples,
itÅfs best to start with the positional range first,
especially for newer players.

Notice IÅfm emphasizing calling with hands that
will keep dominated hands in our opponentÅfs range
and raising with hands which make hands that
dominate us fold. For example, A @Jx has some good
bluff raising properties as it can turn top pair or
the nut flush draw, but raising makes our opponent
fold weaker ace-x and jack-x hands. For this reason,
calling is probably best even if raising is also
profitable.

Likewise, IÅfm raising hands like the J Åë9 # and
T #94 to encourage him to fold hands like ace-jack
and ace-ten. This reduces how often we'll turn top
pair and be out kicked. Additionally, these hands
can effectively double barrel when a straight or
flush draw is turned.
