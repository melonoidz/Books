Analysis: This is a pretty tough river card as we now

only have a few top pair hands. As such, weÅfre

required to either call with nines or allow our

opponent to profitably bluff with any two cards.

However, since he will not be bluffing with a hand

stronger than nines or value betting a weaker hand,

itÅfs still a bluff catcher.

We also can fold enough here to allow our
opponent to profitably bluff with any two cards if
we think the river card is particularly atrocious, but
I donÅft think thatÅfs the case. Additionally, having
tens in our range helps significantly as this makes
our opponent's river overbets less effective.

Analysis: ItÅfs tough to develop ranges for this spot
since the cutoff opening range is so wide and this
flop is hard to play out of position. Although both
the cutoff opening range and the button flatting
range have about 50 percent equity and include
many strong and weak hands, and since position is
so valuable on this board texture, it makes sense to
assume the button is in a more favorable position.

ItÅfs also important to remember that if we donÅft
defend enough checks on this flop, our opponent
will almost always bet. Just as we dislike giving
many hands in his range free cards, he dislikes
giving our check-folding range free cards. While
many players on this flop texture prefer to
recklessly bet and rarely check-call, this clearly is
a weak strategy against a strong opponent. And
since I expect our opponent to frequently bet, my
strategy is to check-raise all sets as well as some
overpairs.

In addition, my strategy includes betting our pair
plus flush draw hands since I want to be able to
check-call with these hands on the turn. Without
them, it would probably be difficult to have flushd:\work\kindle\holdem\705.png @@ draws in our turn check-calling range. Additionally,
these hands do well when facing a raise on the flop,
as they work well as both calls and 3-bets.

When betting a hand like sevens or sixes, weÅfre
hoping our opponent folds despite our usually
being ahead when called. The reason for betting
these hands is to make high equity hands fold, and
if our opponent calls, they can be check-called on
many turn cards.

Lastly, notice that although the strongest hand
in our flop betting range is queens, if the turn is a
blank, it will effectively be the nuts. Our opponent
isnÅft likely to slowplay on this flop, so if he does call,
we can be confident that many our holdings are
best on many turn cards.

Analysis: This is a great example of a spot where
using multiple bet sizes is important. Our opponent
rarely has queens or jacks beat, so making a large
bet with these hands will be a strong play. In
contrast, a large bet with a hand like nines will not
be effective since heÅfll have us beat more often.

In addition, I dislike check-calling with nut type
hands on this board since itÅfs so wet. Sure, our
opponent can overbet all-in when the river comes a
complete blank if he knows we canÅft be strong, but
the river won't blank all that often and giving a free
card is risky.

Furthermore, it should come as no surprise that
we're able to comfortably defend our turn checks
since our flop betting range wasnÅft especially
polarized. In other words, we bet hands such as
sevens and sixes on the flop knowing they'd likely
be check-called on the turn. This was done because
itÅfs desirable to make high equity hands fold, and
our opponent almost always has two overcards to
our sixes.

the same. But if we always or never raise our sets,
our opponent can probably exploit us. Nevertheless,
as usual, itÅfs not worth getting bogged down with

ItÅfs tough to say whether aces or ace-king should

Hopefully, this book got you excited not only
about poker but also with how applying math
and theory can be useful for shedding light on
complex situations even if a solution cannot be

"SY One of the most daunting moments ina poker player's
career occurs when he realizes his knowledge of how
to play a specific hand well is incomplete without the
additional understanding of how to play every other
hand in his range well. This task would be impossible
if a player had to actually think about every other
hand in his range, but by understanding theoretical
sound poker, he can quickly design balanced ranges
using the proper bet-sizing while playing.

Applications of No-Limit Hold Åeem teaches theoretical sound poker, and thus
the ability to create the bet-sizings and ranges that will beat the better players.
The theory in this book is not designed to be complex or abstract, but rather it
is intended to be applied immediately, producing better overall results

Many confusing concepts such as overbetting, balancing multiple bet-sizing
ranges, donk betting, and check-raising as the preflop raiser are crucial to
a player's strategy, despite few players implementing them or talking about
them. After reading this book, you should be able to not only conceptually
understand these ideas, but also know how to begin to incorporate them into
your game and thereby successfully compete against tough opponents.
