Action: The button opens and we call in the big blind.
The flop is thed:\work\kindle\holdem\602.png @@ and both players check. If the turn is the 4 Åë, what
bet sizes make sense with hands in our range?

Explanation: As usual, this is a spot where most
players bet around two-thirds of the pot when they
bet. This is the typical Ågone size fits allÅh usually
employed by players who give little in depth
thought to each players range. While this size will
be effective with some hands in our range, there are
others which should use a different sizing.

When we actually stop and think about our
opponentÅfs flop checking range, it should be
apparent that heÅfd be unlikely to check back any
strong hands. Giving us a free card is risky when
our opponent has a top pair hand, and checking
back a strong hand removes a round of betting from
the game. So itÅfs safe to say heÅfs very unlikely to
check back many or any strong hands on this flop
since betting will almost certainly have a higher
expected value.

Furthermore, the turn card did not put many
strong hands in our opponent's range. He likely onlyd:\work\kindle\holdem\603.png @@ turned five combinations of strong hands  three
combinations of a pair of fours and two of six-four

enough to raise our bet anyway. That is very few
hand combinations relative to how wide the button
flop checking range was, and as a result he has a set
on the turn usually only 2 or 3 percent of the time.
Also be sure to notice that the button is unlikely to
make a straight on this turn card as he would have
bet the flop with a seven-five (that was probably
suited to begin with).

Therefore, we should immediately consider
overbetting in spots where our opponent is unlikely
to raise our bets. This allows us to get more value
from our strong hands as well as bluff more
aggressively. While itÅfs impossible to calculate the
perfect bet size on the turn with any hand, betting
large (over the size of the pot) with king-jack or
stronger will probably be a great play since the
majority of our opponentÅfs range will at best be a
bluff catcher.

Also notice that our opponent wonÅft have an
incentive to check back his strong hands on the
flop and risk giving us a free card as long as weÅfre

we donÅft get too reckless, overbetting some of our
strong hands on the turn should be an effective
play.

But just because large bets with strong hands are
effective does not mean only large bets should
be made. Top pair, weak kicker and medium pair
hands should make smaller bets when bet, and
these ranges must also be balanced with bluffs,
draws, and usually some nut type hands as well.
As seen when using the river bet sizing formula,
smaller bets will be best when our opponent has
us beat reasonably often since this forces him to
defend wider as well as results in a smaller loss for
us when he has the best hand.

It can clearly be seen that many different bet sizes
should be utilized in this spot, but currently most
players are betting only a single size. At the time
of this writing, overbetting this turn is probably
more effective than it should be in theory since
players rarely check back strong hands on the flop

Be sure to notice that since we opened under-the-

fact, his river calling range normally would include
the AaQe, Aaja, AaTa KaQea,andKaja,
none of which he can have since we block the A@
and the Ka. This results in his river range including
more overpair hands, such as queens and jacks
which will usually fold to our river jam.

Further more, if we bet smaller, our opponent can
have a river raising range  a queen or jack high
flush. Additionally, he should balance this range
with some bluffs which will result in our smaller
bets getting additional value. So unlike other spots
where we must overbet to get all-in, we'll still stack
our opponent with smaller bets when he has one of
the strongest hands in his range.

Thus, in spots like this where we block a significant
portion of our opponent's calling range, weÅfll
usually want to bet smaller with the nuts than we
otherwise would. ThatÅfs because overbets cause our
opponent to defend a smaller fraction of his range,

Bet Sizing Example No. 3

Action: We open in the cutoff and the button calls.
He calls our bet on the T v8 v3 @ flop and the turn
comes the 4 Åë. Is betting two-thirds of the pot here
effective with many hands in our range?

Explanation: If we had to pick a Ågone size fits allÅh
sizing, then two-thirds of the pot would probably
be reasonable. This allows us to keep value betting
hands such as king-ten without making our
opponentÅfs range too strong, as well as allows us
to get a reasonable amount of value when betting
overpairs and sets. Players are often told to bet

one size so their hand isnÅft transparent, but as we
already know, thatÅfs incorrect. Multiple bet sizes
should be used and each range should be balanced.

In many ways, this hand is similar to the first
example since this is another spot where our
opponent will normally not raise our turn bet if we
bet two-thirds of the pot. Unless he slowplayed a
strong hand on the flop, heÅfs unlikely to have a handd:\work\kindle\holdem\608.png @@ stronger than ace-ten, and this hand clearly isnÅft
strong enough to raise a medium sized bet. So since
our opponent's range is capped and he won't have a

LetÅfs suppose, on the turn, we decide to use two
bet sizes as opposed to just one like most players
use. In this case, overbetting a range with value
hands which are stronger than ace-ten will be quite
effective since it turns every hand in our opponentÅfs
range into a bluff catcher. And smaller bets will
be effective with a hand like king-ten, since we'll
sometimes be beat.

Of course, weÅfre not restricted to using only two
bet sizes. But even when just two bet sizings are
possible, betting two-thirds of the pot doesnÅft seem
very effective. ThatÅfs because our strong hands
want to bet bigger since they cannot be beat, our
opponent has position, and there are many possible
draws. Yet our weaker value hands, such as king-
ten, would prefer to bet smaller. So even though
most players bet two-thirds of the pot here, itÅfs
actually not an effective sizing with most hands.

So if you're currently only utilizing one bet size in

Bet Sizing Example No. 4

Action: We open in the cutoff with the

flop and does same on the 6 @ turn. If the river
comes the 9 Åë, what size should we bet?

Explanation: Our opponent likely has 16
combinations of king-queen in his range before
removal effects and 9 after removal effects are
applied. Although we have the nuts on the river,
overbetting will not likely be an effective strategyd:\work\kindle\holdem\610.png @@ because if we do, a large fraction of his calling range

But understand that itÅfs not only the removal effect
that encourages us to make smaller river bets, but
also that betting too big should cause our opponent
to call with few hands which arenÅft the nuts.

Sometimes it helps to imagine an extreme example
to visualize a concept. Suppose we're very deep
and on the river overbet 50 pot sized bets. Our bet
would be so large our opponent could fold every
hand except the nuts without fear of us being able
to profitably bluff. (An example is when there is
a three flush on board and we have the ace.) This
results in him only calling with the nuts and we'll
never win any more money than is already in the
pot. So itÅfs possible in some spots to bet so big that it
actually prevents us from getting value since we'll
only end up splitting.

This spot is less common than the other concepts
previously discussed, but it does show why bet
sizing can be so complicated. While itÅfs easy to
ignore removal and splitting effects when talking
in abstract terms, in reality, theyÅfre often relevant.

opponent to either call with these hands and put
more money in the pot when heÅfs behind, or fold
without getting to realize his equity.

Remember, the pot is already so big in 3-bet pots
that itÅfs ok to raise with a capped range since our

In this spot, many players will regularly make
large raises on the flop in an attempt to deny their
opponent odds to call with his flush draws or open

In many poker books, when the author analyzes
a hand he usually discusses how he would play
one hand against a specific type of opponent and
rarely makes more than 3 or 4 decisions. Since these
decisions are usually based on exploitative rather
than theoretical play, they often become outdated
as players continue to adjust to one another. This
is why as players improve they often look back at
the books they read and think much of the advice

The easiest place to start when analyzing hands

us determine how to play the out of position range
because it allows us to estimate how strong hands
need to be to confidently bet one, two, or three
streets for value.

We've already discused the ratios and frequencies

he bets and the player in position will try to defend
at least 60 percent of the time. More advanced

Introduction

The following analyzed hands are always first
approached from the perspective of the player
in position facing a 75 percent pot sized flop bet.
ThatÅfs because this is the best starting point for
hand analysis since we must defend around 60
percent of our range to prevent our opponent from
making an immediate profit betting any two cards.

The same process occurs on the turn and river, as
we'll once again assume we're facing a 75 percent
pot sized bet after our opponent bet the previous
street. Again, this requires us to defend around 60
percent of our range to prevent our opponent from
making an immediate profit. Of course, he wonÅft
always bet the turn or river, and when he doesn't,
we'll have to figure out whether to bet or check,
but itÅfs not realistic to take into account each of our
opponentÅfs possible actions.

Once weÅfve analyzed how the player in position
should respond when facing bets on all three
streets, weÅfre ready to begin designing our outd:\work\kindle\holdem\635.png @@ of position flop ranges. These ranges should be
designed as if we donÅft know what the turn or river
card will be, but after designing positional ranges,
we'll usually have a good idea of what hands work
well as value bets. These are also the hardest ranges
to create, as multiple ranges need to be balanced at
once and there are many combinations of hands.

Next, we'll analyze out of position turn and river
play assuming the previous street was bet for 75
percent of the pot. Once more, this won't always
be true, but itÅfs impossible to take into account all
possible actions from earlier streets. The widest and
more important ranges often occur after the out of
position player bet and the in position player called,
and as such these are the ranges weÅfll focus on.

The same methodology showcased in this section
can be used to improve post-flop play in other
situations. For instance, intermediate players who
hope to become expert players should focus on how
to play the turn and river after check-calling on
the flop. Likewise, they should also aim to improve
their play in 3-bet pots since more money is at stake
and these situations occur frequently in button
versus blind situations against strong opponents.

Lastly, always remember these ranges are

Hand No. 1: Under-the-

First, letÅfs examine the initial caller in the cutoff.

Total Combos Defended: 72 (67%)
Analysis: Our range is strong and itÅfs easy to defend
well over 60 percent of our hands. I decided to raise
all sets since our calling range already includes ace-
king hands (making it difficult for our opponent to
overbet the turn), but calling with some sets to raise
on non-diamond turns would be fine as well.

Pocket nines and pocket eights with a diamond

barreled when they turn a straight draw. If we check

back on a diamond turn, we may river the flush and
beat our opponent when he has an ace-king type

The worst hand in our calling range is pocket tens,
which seems reasonable. ThereÅfs no way to tell if
calling with tens without a diamond is profitable,
and since we're already defending 67 percent of our
range, itÅfs possible they should be folded or we can
bluff raise a combination or two less. Yet overall,
this looks like a solid defending strategy.

opponent to continue to draw with all of his flush

be best, but for the most part, I prefer to call.

Notice weÅfre calling with 24 made hands and

5 flush draws. This allows us, on the river, to

bluff with most if not all of our missed draws

in a balanced range if our opponent checks.

Analysis: We want to value raise ace-king and balance

that with around 2 combinations of bluffs, then call

with as many marginal strength hands as we need
to prevent our opponent from being able to bluff
too much. This is a really interesting spot, and since

so much of our range on the river is ace-queen, itd:\work\kindle\holdem\640.png @@ actually makes sense to bluff raise sometimes, call
sometimes, and fold other times. This by definition
means the expected value of raising, calling, and

In practice, we should be careful when bluff
raising this river. If our opponentÅfs value range is
so polarized that almost all of his value bets are
ace-king, then we shouldnÅft raise any bluffs on this
river. ItÅfs a weird spot where our opponentÅfs range

Minimum EV of our opponent's air on flop: (0.635)[(0.43)(8)-

Analysis: Since our opponentÅfs range is strong on

this flop and he has the advantage of position, our

continuation betting frequency should be quite

low. Therefore, betting 36.5 percent of the time

seems reasonable as that keeps our checking range

strong but still allows us to value bet with our ace-

king hands.

Position is not especially valuable on this board,
so itÅfs easy to check-call aggressively on the flop
and keep the minimum expected value of our
opponentÅfs air low, to the point where he almost
doesnÅft even make an immediate profit by betting.
Check-calling with top set put some very strong
hands in our check-calling range, and if we bet or
check-raise, weÅfre unlikely to get much action when
our hand removes two-third of the aces from the
deck.

probably possible to bluff raise an additional hand

aggressively, it helps to develop a check-raising and

check-called, check-raise bluffed, or check-folded.
Remember, we'd technically need to balance our
check-calling range and not only check-call with
king-queen, but if our opponent bets the turn,
check-calling with just a few hands will often be

break even or slightly profitable.

many bluff catchers while ours is polarized.
Likewise, since our river checking range includes

the pot with his missed bluffs. Check-raising will
not be effective since heÅfll frequently check behind

Total combos defended: 86

Analysis: Although at a glance this board texture

looks bad for our range, we still have 48 percent

equity against the UTG opening range and six
combinations of sets. While raising this flop will
make it more difficult for our opponent to bet hands

such as nines and tens for a single street of value, I

prefer to instead call with eights and fours since we

are in position and can comfortably raise any turn
card. In other words, giving a free card isnÅft risky.

ItÅfs important to remember ace-king and ace-
queen can easily be checked down and win at
showdown after calling a flop bet in addition to
improve. Additionally, itÅfs difficult to say whether
sevens can be profitably called here, or if itÅfs a
superior hand to ace-queen. I think theyÅfre both
close to break even and have no problem with
calling a few ace-queen offsuit hands, but decided
to just call with sevens.

Analysis: This turn card is tricky since it puts no
additional strong hands in our range. However, it
does allow us to continue to slowplay our flopped
sets since they are now full houses and raising a
few of these hands would make it more difficult
for our opponent to bet only two streets for value.
Therefore, I think calling and encouraging him to
continue bluffing is superior.

There are also almost no draws in our range since
the board is so dry. This means we'll need to bluff
with some ace-king hands if our opponent checks
tous on the river despite the fact that these hands
have showdown value. Another option on the turn

This is an especially difficult spot to analyze
because itÅfs tough to tell what line is best with
our middle pairs. On one hand, IÅfm tempted to bet
hands like JJ, TT, and 99 since giving free cards is
risky. But even if we bet jacks, our opponent wonÅft
fold many AK, AQ, or KQs hands. (Just because
we chose to fold our ace-queen off suit hands and
call with sevens doesnÅft mean itÅfs correct or our
opponent will.) So it may be best to check-call with
jacks since betting doesnÅft make too many hands
with overcards fold anyway. Furthermore, if our
opponent checks back with tens and nines, we'll
usually be able to get value on the turn and river
with jacks anyway.

Betting tens and nines with the intention of only
betting for one or two streets of value may be best.
When our opponent folds queen-jack suited and
queen-ten suited and we hold nines, itÅfs much
more useful than if we held jacks (since a turn ten
outdraws our nines but gives him a losing top pair
hand with jacks). So even though we have no way
of solving for what line is best, betting these hands
while check-calling jacks seems reasonable.d:\work\kindle\holdem\650.png @@ Before designing our check-calling and check-
raising range, notice if we rarely defend our checks
our opponent will bet aggressively since giving free
cards to our check-folding range is risky. This is a
spot where players rarely check-call or check-raise,
but thatÅfs unacceptable against skilled opponents
so long as we have a checking range. And since
we're out of position and our range isnÅft much
stronger than our opponents, we probably should
check reasonably often. (This would be even more
true if he had all possible sets in his range, but
luckily we assumed he folded deuces preflop.)

ItÅfs important our check-calling range is balanced
and stresses keeping hands in our opponentÅfs range
that we dominate. For this reason, check-calling
with ace-king is often an excellent play (though this
hand can sometimes be bet as well). This ensures
our opponent sees the turn with all of his AQ, AJ,
and KQ hands, as well as gives us the opportunity
to see a free turn card if he checks back a hand like
nines or tens. Nevertheless, our check-calling range
must be balanced, so check-calling a pair of jacks or
a few sets is necessary.

Also notice that occasionally check-raising makes
it less profitable for our opponent to recklessly bet
the flop with his marginal hands, and encourages
