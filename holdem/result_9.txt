While turn decisions in 3-bet pots are undoubtedly
important since so much money is at stake, itÅfs
important to remember the pot will often usually
be quite large before any turn betting takes
place. That is, since the pot is so large relative to

a few pages focusing on these situations since

Furthermore, new players would probably be

isnÅft true, itÅfs important to remember the 3-bettor

nearly all the theoretical concepts weÅfve discussed
previously for single raised pots will apply as well.

While we've only discussed 100 big blind starting
stack play up until this point, it should be noted
that this stack depth is especially relevant for this
section. More specifically, as stack depth changes,
much of the math shown in the following pages

Barreling in a 3-Bet Pot

LetÅfs begin with analyzing how to play the turn
when out of position in a 3-bet pot after betting the
flop. While it of course makes sense to follow the
usual practice of betting with a polarized range,
it serves little purpose to repeat all the math and
frequencies which have already been discussed.
(That said, itÅfs important to keep in mind we
usually want a bit more than half of our double
barrels in 3-bet pots to be for value.) Rather, our
focus will be on taking the right lines with the right
types of hands and picking bet sizings which make
sense.

As previously shown, if, on the flop, the starting
pot size is 25 big blinds and we bet 12.5 big blinds,
then the pot will be 50 big blinds before any betting
takes place on the turn. If we then bet 25 big blinds
on the turn and our opponent goes all-in for 75 big
blinds total, our call will risk 50 big blinds to win
150 big blinds, and this requires only 25 percent
equity for calling to be profitable. And since ourd:\work\kindle\holdem\468.png @@ hand requires exactly 25 percent equity to be
indifferent to calling, any hand with less equity
than this should be folded to our opponentÅfs turn
jam.

Unfortunately, most open ended straight draws
and flush draws have slightly less than 25 percent
equity against our opponentÅfs turn jamming range.
In other words, draws have nearly the maximum
amount of equity possible that still require us to
fold once we face a turn jam after betting 50 percent
of the pot. Few outcomes in poker are worse than
putting in half of our stack with a high equity draw
only to have to fold, so special precautions should
be taken to try to prevent this from happening.

There are several ways to avoid bet-folding a high
equity draw on the turn. The first is to simply check.
This way we'll either get to see a free river card if
our opponent checks or can check-call or check-
raise all-in if he bets.

An optimal opponent will be aware of how
undesirable it is to have to bet-fold the turn in a 3-
bet pot with a draw, as well as how difficult it is to
check-call on many board textures after betting
the flop (since our range for the most part should
be polarized). This encourages our opponent to
make small bets on the turn, and when he does,d:\work\kindle\holdem\469.png @@ check-calling with a flush draw is likely to be

in a 3-bet pot, and this often makes our check-calls
less effective and our check-raises more effective
than they should be. (Our check-raises are more
effective since the pot is bigger when our opponent
folds.)

Another option is to simply overbet the turn all-in.
Our opponent will often fold to such a large bet and
when he doesnÅft, weÅfll get to realize the equity of
our hand since we're all in. For instance, if the pot is
50 big blinds on the turn, our turn jam will be for 75
big blinds or 1.5 pot sized bets. However, this large
overbet may be best as itÅfs quite easy to develop a
balanced jamming range which consists of strong
hands and high equity bluffs in this spot. This is
especially true since many of our 3-bet bluffs were
suited connectors and gappers which frequently
make straight or flush draws on the turn and are
excellent bluffs.

ItÅfs also important to note that keeping our
opponentÅfs range wide is usually a desirable
outcome as this means heÅfll ultimately felt weaker

hands. However, if we know our hand has sod:\work\kindle\holdem\470.png @@ much equity that we cannot fold to our opponentÅfs
turn jam, large bets are often best because they
maximize our fold equity.

Additionally, itÅfll be easier to go all-in on the turn
after making a larger bet on the flop. That is, betting
larger on the flop with a range that consist of many
hands which will want to overbet jam on the turn
is usually best. This allows us to win a bigger pot
when our opponent folds and requires us to risk less
money on the turn relative to the size of the pot.

HereÅfs an example. Rather than betting 12.5 big
blinds on the flop and 75 big blinds on the turn,
we can instead bet more on the flop so our overbet
on the turn isnÅft so massive relative to the pot-
size. More specifically, the pot will be 61 big blinds
following an 18 big blind flop bet and our turn jam
will be for 69.5 big blinds or 1.14 pot sized bets.
While this is still quite a large bet, itÅfs significantly
less than betting 75 big blinds into a 50 big blind
pot for a 1.5 pot sized bet.

Keep in mind itÅfs theoretically correct to utilize
many different bet sizings in the same spot since
this maximizes the expected value of each hand.

25 percent equity forces our opponent to call 75

Although calling the turn likely makes our
opponent felt a wider range than raising does, this
is a small change proportionally compared to other
spots. For instance, jamming a range where the
worst bluff has 15 percent equity on the turn in
a 3-bet pot will require our opponent to felt 62.5
percent of his betting range. If we call instead,
he will have to bet at most 75 percent of his turn

In contrast, when we raise a flop bet in a single
raised pot our opponent is able to fold over half of
his flop betting range without our flop raise being
immediately profitable (since our flop raise is to
18 big blinds to win 14 big blinds). This results in
him felting a much stronger range on the river for
a much larger pot when compared to just calling.

money left relative to the size of the pot after our

fold.

We now need to decide whether we should raise
or flat when facing a bet on the turn with a draw.
Again, the board textures where we have draws in
our range are the same board textures where the
opponent is likely to value bet the turn with the
intention of checking the river since giving free
cards is risky. Yet this is less of an issue in 3-bet pots
since his 3-betting range is already polarized and
betting only the flop and turn for value is especially
difficult when out of position.

LetÅfs suppose our draw will only river the nuts, and
when our opponent bets the turn for 25 big blinds
into a 50 big blind pot he plans to bet the river 75

not only the 75 big blinds in the pot but also an

Although calling will always be profitable if our

we're able to make a profitable river bluff after our
opponent checks. Remember, he needs to check-
call at least 66.7 percent of the time to make our
river bluff jams unprofitable and this is not usually
possible. This, of course, makes sense theoretically.
We risked 25 big blinds by calling the turn to only
occasionally get the opportunity to profitably bluff
the river. Further more, we may call with draws
which have less than 18.2 percent equity (which is
around how much equity an open ended straight
draw has vs. an over pair) and only the worst hand
in our turn calling range should be approximately
break even.

profitably bet any two cards.

In this spot, calling our opponent with an open
ended straight draw on the turn will be a very
profitable play. We'll stack him often enough to
justify the price of our call on the turn since we'll
river the nuts 17.4 percent of the time, and when
our opponent does check the river, heÅfll almost

profitable, he may not bet the river as aggressively
when the river card brings the flush. ThatÅfs because
he may think there are many flushes in our range
as well as having bet the turn with a medium
strength hand, such as pocket tens, which feared
giving a free card. (Some players may choose to bet ad:\work\kindle\holdem\485.png @@ medium strength hand on the flop and the turn, but

check-fold once he checks. Lastly, weÅfre not drawing
to the nuts, so we'll sometimes be beat after making
the flush. Put simply, it will often occur that small
straight draws in 3-bet pots do better than flush
draws despite having one less out.

Although it can be difficult to tell if itÅfs best to
call, raise, or fold a draw on the turn (and we'll
usually need to do some combination of at least
two), the hands which make the best value raises

strong yet still vulnerable to being outdrawn by

Playing the turn when out of position in 3-bet pots
can be tricky since bet-folding draws is so difficult.
In addition, our bets will often be a bit bigger out of
position than in position because our opponent will
be less likely to go all-in and destroy his positional
advantage, but we should be extra careful to avoid
bet-folding high equity draws when possible. In
general, small bets are effective in position since
this forces our opponent to call wider and play the
river out of position.

If both players check on the flop, itÅfs important to
bet according to how strong our hand is relative
to our opponentÅfs range. Consequently, betting big
on the turn will often be effective with a range of
strong value hands and bluffs, but if our value bets
are relatively weak, betting smaller should be best
since this requires our opponent to call with a wider
range on the turn and the river. Plus it allows us to
win more frequently at showdown.

In addition, itÅfs important to remember that
raising the turn in 3-bet pots does not greatly
strengthen our opponent's felting range relative
to raising in single raised pots. ThatÅfs becaused:\work\kindle\holdem\490.png @@ raising the turn all-in ensures we're able to realize

there are many draws in his range. Here are a few
more important points:

1. After the flop checks through in a 3-bet pot, a
variety of different bet sizings are possible on
the turn and the river. In general, around a 1-

used.

2. We should try to avoid facing a break even call
with a strong draw against our opponentÅfs turn
jam. More specifically, betting 50 percent of the
pot on the flop and turn with hands which have
approximately 25 percent equity is risky if our
opponent will often move all-in.

3. For each 1 percent of equity our hand has when
called after going all-in on the turn, our bluffis

We've now come to the final street, and it may
surprise you to see there is only one chapter on river
play. ThatÅfs because nearly every relevant concept
for river play has already been discussed in detail
in previous sections. Consequently, we'll focus our

which differ from flop and turn play.

Most importantly, since there are no additional
cards to come, more precise ranges and bet sizings
can be made. On the earlier rounds, we were never
able to convert equity into expected value since
there were additional cards to come, but this is
possible in some river situations. As such, river play
usually requires the smallest amount of guesswork
when applying theory.

River Jams

Many players donÅft truly understand how river
value bets work and this causes them to develop
leaks in other aspects of their game. In fact, the
term Ågvalue betÅh is often misleading and confusing
since value bets on the river donÅft always work
the same way as they do on other streets. More
specifically, how strong our hand needs to be to
value bet on the river will depend on whether weÅfre
in or out of position.

When in position, our river bet needs to win at
least half the time when called to make betting
more profitable than checking. This should be
quite intuitive since betting against our opponentÅfs
check-folding range accomplishes nothing as there
are no more cards to come and we'll win the pot
either way. So all we care about is how our handd:\work\kindle\holdem\496.png @@ does against his calling and check-raising raise and
betting will always have a negative expected value
relative to checking if our opponent wins more
often than we do once he calls (or raises).

This concept often confuses players since a
value bet on the river does not imply we want
our opponent to call. Keep in mind this was true
for other streets as well, but itÅfs more difficult to
visualize on other streets since there are additional
cards to come.

HereÅfs an example. On the river, our opponent
who is first to act checks and we have a pot sized
bet remaining. Going all-in for one pot sized bet
requires our opponent to call half the time to
keep us indifferent to bluffing and because weÅfre
all-in, he wonÅft have the opportunity to raise.
Furthermore, letÅfs assume he has us beat 20 percent
of the time. This means when we bet the river, our
opponent will fold 50 percent of the time, call with
the worse hand 30 percent of the time, and call with
the better hand 20 percent of the time. Therefore,
the expected value of betting is 0.9 pot sized bets.

0.9 = (0.50)(1) + (0.3)(2)  (0.2)(1)
where

0.50 is our opponentÅfs folding frequency,d:\work\kindle\holdem\497.png @@ 0.30 is the proportion of times our opponent calls
and loses, and

0.20 is the proportion of times our opponent calls
and wins.

LetÅfs compare this expected value to that of
checking. And since our opponent has us beat 20
percent of the time, weÅfll win 80 percent of the
time. Therefore, the expected value of checking is
0.8 pot sized bets.

0.8 = (0.80)(1) + (0.20)(0)
where
0.80 is our winning frequency,
0.20 is our losing frequency, and
1is the size of the pot.

Since value betting has a higher expected value
than checking, itÅfs the superior play. Nevertheless,
after value betting, we're still hoping our opponent
folds. ThatÅfs because we'll lose 40 percent of
the time once he calls since 40 percent of our
opponentÅfs calling range beats us.

We can solve for our expected value after our
opponent calls and before he shows us whether he
has the best hand. Since we win 60 percent of the
time and lose 40 percent of the time once called, our

expected value is 0.8 pot sized bets.
0.8 = (0.60)(2)  (0.40)(1)d:\work\kindle\holdem\498.png @@ where
0.60 is our winning frequency,
0.40 is our losing frequency,
2 is the size of the pot when we win, and

Notice if we bet and our opponent folds, we'll
always win a single pot sized bet. But if he calls,
our average win will be only 0.8 pot sized bets. So
despite us winning the majority of the time when
called and betting being the superior play, we still
hope he folds to our river bet.

This concept should be fairly obvious to advanced
players, but it often confuses new players and
results in them not value betting the river
aggressively enough  it just feels awkward to bet
the river for value in position while rooting for our
opponent to fold when checking back is so easy and

Although value betting the river in position
and hoping our opponent folds may at first seem
counterintuitive, itÅfs always more profitable to
jam than check as long as we win over half the
time when called.12 Remember though, that a river

19 When our opponent can raise itÅfs a bit more
complicated, and this will be discussed in the
following chapter.

Now letÅfs discuss value betting the river when out
of position. The key difference is itÅfs often superior
to bet with a hand which will lose over half the
time when called rather than check. Again, this
should be a concept most advanced players are
already familiar with.22 But weaker players who
donÅft understand this idea often think highly
skilled players are playing overly aggressively when
in reality theyÅfre playing much closer to game
theoretically optimal than theyÅfd expect.

20 Because David Sklansky explained it in detail thirty-five years
ago.

HereÅfs an example. We once again find ourselves
on the river with a pot sized bet left, only now weÅfre
out of position and our opponent has us beat 30
percent instead of 20 percent of the time. In this
situation, if we go all-in for a single pot sized betd:\work\kindle\holdem\500.png @@ and he calls 50 percent of the time, our expected
value will be 0.6 pot sized bets.

0.50 is our opponentÅfs folding frequency,

0.30 is the proportion of times our opponent calls
and wins,
1 is the size of the pot or the size of our bet, and
2 is the number of bets we win when our
opponent calls and loses.

In position, it would clearly not make sense to bet
with our hand since we would lose over half the
time when called  checking in position has an
expected value of 0.7 pot sized bets. However, when
out of position, our opponent has the opportunity
to bet after we check and can bet with a balanced
range of value bets and bluffs on the river. This
makes checking out of position less profitable than
checking in position.

LetÅfs assume once we check on the river our
opponent will always value bet the 30 percent of
his range which beats us in a balanced range for
a single pot sized bet. Since we'll get 2-to-1 odds
on our call, a balanced betting range should have
