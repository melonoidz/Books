Indifferent to Bluffing

We often think our opponent should not be able

be some hands in his range that are +EV to bluff
while others are -EV. In these cases, our opponent is
required to bluff hands with the right equity for his
bluffs to be profitable.

HereÅfs an example. A player opens in the cutoff
and only the button calls. If the flop comes the
Qwv74#64@, the cutoff will almost certainly be able
to profitably bet the T #9 @ since it has four outs
to the nuts, can catch a running flush, and can
also turn a winning middle pair. This is almost
certainly a profitable bet against an optimal playing
opponent.

Much weaker hands, such as a pair of deuces, are
not likely to be profitable as a continuation bet

best chance of getting lucky with his bluffs and
outdrawing his opponent on future streets. Notice
that this player bluffs in a random way that is
determined by the hand heÅfs holding and the board
texture rather than if he simply feels like bluffing.

In this book, when we say Ågwe want our opponent
to break even with his weak bluffs,Åh it will usually

hand in his betting range. That is our opponentÅfs
best bluffing hands are clearly going to be profitable
since they have the best chance to improve on
future streets or the best removal effects. However,
in many spots, the worst hand in our opponentÅfs
theoretically correct betting range should only be
slightly profitable.

Introduction

As we continue through this book, you'll start
to notice a few general trends when approaching
problems from a theoretical perspective. First, we'll
not always be able to approach a solution using
math and theory alone, and such problems require
atrial and error approach. Specifically, a powerful
computer could theoretically solve the game of
poker and develop an optimal strategy through
such an approach, but such a solution would
require nearly a countless amount of simulations.
On the other hand, the game of checkers was
solved in 2007 using this method, and the solution
would require a player to memorize 5x10ÅhÅãpossible
positions to ensure he always plays perfectly. But
poker is much more complex because not all the
information is available to both players. So while
itÅfs possible for the game of poker to eventually be
solved, itÅfs unlikely to happen anytime soon.

Second, we should note that the best way to
approach a problem may often seem backwards ord:\work\kindle\holdem\066.png @@ cause us to pause for a while and come back later
when we have more information. For instance,
suppose on the flop we want to figure out what
our bluffing to value raising ratio should be. To
accomplish this, we must first know how often
we're going to bet the river with a balanced range,
what bet sizing should be used on the turn and
river, and how position effects our range. Notice
that this is a large amount of information, and
obviously it would be quite difficult to know where
to start if a new player asked us ÅgCan you explain
how to balance a value to bluff raising ratio on the
flop and where the numbers come from?Åh

We will approach many problems like this, and
itÅfs important to remember to remain patient and
know these questions will eventually be answered
as we discuss more concepts. Your confusion will
come to an end as we cover more topics and have
more Ågah-hahÅh moments when multiple concepts
come together and the math and logic behind
theoretically sound poker begins to make more
sense.

Last, and perhaps most important, notice that
while we usually canÅft solve for the exact solution,
theory can be used to tell us when something
is not optimal. This is especially important ford:\work\kindle\holdem\067.png @@ this current section of the book. When we know
something must be wrong with our ranges or bet
sizing, we can focus our attention to that specific
area of our game and try to find a strategy which
has no glaring theoretical errors.

For instance, we'll quickly see that it likely doesnÅft
make sense for every position to 3-bet QQ+/AK
against a pot-sized under-the-gun (UTG) open.

If every player 3-bets these hands for value and
balances the range with the proper amount of
bluffs, then the UTG player will be 3-bet too much
and will stop opening with those hands he plans
on folding to a 3-bet. So while this doesnÅft tell us
exactly what the optimal ranges are for defending
against an UTG open, it still provides a useful
starting point for designing ranges.

Our general approach to preflop play will be to
start with analyzing the basic ranges most winning
players currently use and then modify them as we
see how they can be exploited. Once weÅfre using
ranges and bet sizings that give our opponents no
clear way to exploit us, our strategy will probably be
closer to game theoretical optimal than it originally
was. This will make approaching preflop play much
easier than starting out completely from scratchd:\work\kindle\holdem\068.png @@ which would at best be difficult and at worst close

every possible position, we can analyze the effects
of the most commonly used sizings and see how
they affect each playerÅfs ranges and frequencies. In
addition, notice that the methodology we discuss
will be much more important than making sure we
used the perfect sizings. In reality, small changes in
sizing usually only slightly alter each playerÅfs range.
Also, keep in mind that online most players have
100 big blind stacks and a common opening size is
a pot-sized open for 3.5 big blinds in most positions
other than the button. In addition, good players

against the 3-bet  there are still players yet to act
who may have a strong hand or decide to bluff.

HereÅfs an example. The cutoff opens to 3.5 big
blinds and the button 3-bets to 10 big blinds. Since

But no-limit hold Åfem isnÅft always this simple.
ThatÅfs because players usually make smaller 3-
bets in position than out of position since they
want to encourage their opponent to call so they
get to see a flop (in position). If we raise first in and
an opponent makes a small 3-bet, heÅfll usually be
in position and there will be multiple people left
to act who can help us defend. If this player is out
of position, his 3-bet will usually be larger so we
won't have to defend as much even if there are no
other players left to act. In general, our strategy will
usually be to defend at least 27 to 31 percent of our
opens against 3-bets.*
3 This number will increase the more we are calling rather than 4-
betting as we will discuss later in this section of the book.

The most common 4-bet sizings are usually
around 22 to 24 big blinds to win a pot of around
15 to 16 big blinds. If the original raiser 4-bets, hed:\work\kindle\holdem\072.png @@ effectively only risks 18.5 to 20.5 big blinds since

make an immediate profit, whereas a 4-bet cold
from one of the blinds must succeed around 60
percent of the time to make an immediate profit.

Lastly, a player can 5-bet bluff which will almost
always result in him going all in when stack sizes
are 100 big blinds or less. So when someone 5-bet
bluff jams, heÅfll usually be using a small pocket pair
or a weak suited ace since these hands have the
most equity when called.

However, how much equity a specific hand has
will change significantly based on the opponentÅfs
calling range. For instance, against a calling range
of JJ+/AK, a pair of treys and ace-five suited have
32.2 and 30.7 percent equity respectively. But
against a calling range of aces and kings, the pair of
treys has only 18.4 percent equity while the ace-five
suited has 26.7 percent equity.

Another point to consider is the 5-bet bluff will
usually come from the original 3-bettor, and since
he has already invested around 11 big blinds, heÅfs
only risking on average another 89 big blinds
(assuming he starts the hand with 100 big blinds)d:\work\kindle\holdem\073.png @@ by going all in. Therefore, since the final pot will

called, his expectation is 62.5 big blinds when his
opponent does not fold,

62.5 = (201.5)(0.31)

betting respectively.

Summing up, the frequencies at which 3-bet, 4-

First In Ranges

Before we can develop 3-bet ranges versus
opens from different positions, we must first
understand what makes a hand theoretically
correct to raise first in. Since the expected value
of folding is zero, a player should raise first in
with any hand that has a positive expected
value.Åe That is, the worst hand in a raise first in
range should be close to 0 EV since itÅfs just barely
above or equal to the expectation of folding.
Therefore, we can make the following four
assumptions about the properties of the worst
hand in a game theoretically optimal playerÅfs
raise first in range.

4 Of course, in games with certain player types, the expectation
for some hands may be highest by calling (often referred to as

limping). But that possibility will not be considered here.

seen to be playing too many highly specu-
lative hands early and thus is vulnerable to
reraises and other plays. Hence the expecta-

be negative.

. The hand should frequently fold when fac-

to defend against raises with the weakest
hands in the opening range.Åf The EV lost will
be equal to the size of the preflop open.

hand in an opening range can become a
strong hand on the flop.)

between 54 and 60 percent of the time against

Consequently, the worst hand in an opening

reasons.

1. It is weaker than the average hand in a preflop
cold calling range.

2. On the flop, the preflop raiser will often be out
of position unless he opened on the button or is
just called by a blind.

3. If one of the blinds does call (thus letting the
preflop raiser see a flop in position), the pot will
be smaller since there is less extra dead money
from the blinds.

ItÅfs important to design ranges where all of our
theory and beliefs make sense and must not

process. We now are equipped with a great set of
restrictions, or parameters, which will tell us what

When a player responds to a 3-bet by only 4-

must 4-bet between 25 to 30 percent of their
preflop opening range. When facing a 5-bet, they

These defending ranges allow us to get a glimpse
of what hands make effective value 3-bets against
opponents who defend only by 4-betting or folding.
For instance, against a 15 percent raise first in it
makes little to no sense to 3-bet and 5-bet a hand
like queens or ace-king offsuit since the preflop
raiser will never felt worse. A raise first-in of 15
percent is around what many players use for an
UTG open, and the inability to 3-bet and 5-bet ace-
king offsuit for value against an UTG open in six
max is consistent with the theory from ÅgMaximum
3-Betting RangesÅh starting on page 41. This does
not mean ace-king offsuit will never be a 3-bet
against an UTG open, but itÅfs usually a call.

LetÅfs now analyze the profitably of 4-betting with
the intention of calling a 5-bet. To accomplish this,
assume we win 12.5 big blinds total for the hand
when our 4-bet is successful and that our 4-bet isd:\work\kindle\holdem\090.png @@ successful 60 percent of the time.Åe We will thus win

every time we 4-bet.
6 Remember, slight changes in these numbers will not greatly affect
our results.

7.5 = (0.6)(12.5)

The remaining 40 percent of the time our
opponent will jam and we'll call, and our
expectation will be decided by our equity times
the final pot-size. For example, in a 201.5 big blind
pot, if our 4-bet has 45 percent equity against our
opponentÅfs 5-bet jamming range, the total amount
we will expect to win with our hand will be -9.325
big blinds.

~9.325 =(0.45)(201.5) 100

(with the remaining 60 percent producing a profit
of 7.5 big blinds), our overall expectation is 0.77 big
blinds.

0.77 = (0.60)(7.5) + (0.40)(9.325)

Note the following tables show how much we
expect to win or lose overall for the hand when we
4-bet. So since folding to a 3-bet results in us losing

For instance, aces will face a 5-bet less often than

aces and ace-king. However, it also blocks hands

Notice the above results should be quite

with ace-king or jacks in the cutoff against a 3-

total expected value of 1.5 and -0.7 big blinds
respectively. This suggests we should be calling 3-
bets with these hands, especially in position, where
we will almost certainly have a higher expectation
since this keeps the opponentÅfs range wider.

Many players would also be surprised to learn
that the only hand they should be happy to get all

kings show only a small profit by being 4-bet  we

An UTG player who decides to 4-bet and call with
queens should expect to lose over 4 big blinds on
average with the hand.

These felting ranges are probably stronger than
most players would expect and further reinforce
what the math in ÅgMaximum 3-Betting RangesÅh
suggested. We cannot 3-bet ace-king and queens

and 4-Bets

We're almost ready to begin analyzing the effects
of flatting a 3-bet. Yet before we can do this, it must
be understood why we also need to have a flatting
range against 4-bets. As mentioned previously,
most players will not flat 4-bets whether they are in
or out of position. This is often justified by claiming
there is too much money in the pot and bluffs
have at least 20 percent equity against even a very
strong calling range. More importantly, they do not
want to be faced with a tough decision post-flop.
However, this is a poor approach and players should
be willing to call 4-bets for the following reasons:

1. Hands in the value 4-betting range are stronger
than the weakest hands in the value 3-betting
range. If a player 5-bets the weakest hand in his
value 3-betting range, he will never be ahead
when called.

2. 5-betting ensures either all the money gets in

preflop or no one sees a flop. This takes awayd:\work\kindle\holdem\097.png @@ the positional advantage the 3-bettor would
have if he called the 4-bet when in position.

3. Even if a hand has only 20 percent equity

needs to see the turn or river to become best.
Overpairs can ensure all the money gets in on
the flop or turn on threatening boards before
the opponent gets to see additional cards. In
other words, our opponent will have a difficult
time realizing the equity of his semi-blufts.

In addition, changing one aspect of strategy will
often impact other areas of our game as well. For
instance, suppose we decide to defend a wider
range against our opponentÅfs 3-bets to make
his 3-bet bluffs successful less often. While this
does force our opponent to play a 3-bet pot out of
position at a higher frequency, it also weakens our
calling range which in turn increases the expected
value of our opponentÅfs weak post-flop hands.
