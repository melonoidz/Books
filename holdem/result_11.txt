in Multiway Pots

Since players are required to defend less frequently
in multiway pots, itÅfs important to emphasize
calling with hands which have the potential to
make nut type hands by the river. Marginal hands
still need to sometimes be called, but they should
usually either have some chance to improve on
the turn and river (such as a top or medium pair
hand with 3 toa flush and 3 toa straight) or be
quite strong and not particularly vulnerable to our
opponentÅfs bluffs.

Calling with a marginal made hand is less desirable
in a multiway pot for a few reasons. First, if there
are still players left to act, one of these can put ina
raise after we call. This happens both preflop and
post-flop, and when it does occur, we'll usually have
to fold or make close to a break even call. Putting
more money into the pot only to later be faced with
a close to break-even call is an undesirable outcome
which should be avoided when possible.d:\work\kindle\holdem\552.png @@ Additionally, made hands usually have a
significant amount of equity against a single
draw, but do poorly against multiple draws. For
instance, if we have an overpair and are facing only
a straight draw on the flop, then our opponent will
usually have 8 outs. But if weÅfre up against two
opponents and one has a straight draw while the
other has a flush draw with an overcard, then our
opponents can have as many as 18 outs combined,
and itÅfs much easier to dodge 8 outs than 18 outs.
Furthermore, since we'll likely have to fold to
additional bets on the turn and river even when the
draws miss, itÅfs unlikely we'll win a large pot. This
encourages us to try to avoid calling with medium
strength hands when multiple players may have
draws.

Lastly, notice that since we'll need to defend fewer
hands multiway, our strong draws will usually
make up a larger fraction of our defending range.
ItÅfs thus not necessary to call with as many bluff
catchers to prevent our opponent from being able
to show an immediate profit on his bluffs. We'll of
course still need to call with some medium strength
hands since only calling with draws will result in us

plays poorly out of position, and it will almost
never beat a non-bluff when facing bets on multiple
streets unless it makes at least two pair. Remember,

guesswork than river play since there are so many
cards left to come, so itÅfs impossible to solve for
what line is best. However, while calling with a
hand which will mostly flop only mediocre made

Preflop Hands

Most players intuitively understand that the ability
to make nut type hands becomes more important
in multiway pots. However, this causes them to
overrate speculative hands, especially preflop.
Suited connectors and gappers are regularly called
when they should be 3-bet bluffed or folded preflop
and itÅfs important to understand why.

1. Suited connectors often make three to a flush
and three to a straight type hands as well as
gutshots. These holdings can bluff raise and
float profitably when facing a bet in heads up
pots, but they usually must be folded in multi-
way pots.

2. Since ranges get strong quickly in multiway
pots, itÅfs often difficult to get value with weak
flushes. ItÅfs obvious when the flush is possible
and ranges are now so strong that sometimes
players won't even need to felt all of their set
combos (much less two pairs or overpairs)

when facing bets or raises. This often makes itd:\work\kindle\holdem\556.png @@ difficult to get action with a weak flush unless
the opponent has us beat.

3. The pot-size and our opponent's bet size on the
flop will be large relative to the remaining stack
sizes. This decreases the implied odds of our
draw relative to the pot size and makes it diffi-
cult to profitably call with weak draws.

HereÅfs an example. ItÅfs usually quite profitable
to call with a draw when our opponent bets 4 big
blinds into a 6 big blind pot since there is so much
stack depth remaining. This is especially true if
we're drawing to the nuts since a small investment
can potentially win our opponentÅfs stack. But if
he bets 10 big blinds into a 15 big blind pot, we'll
have to risk a much larger fraction of our stack in
an attempt to get all-in with the nuts by the river.
This makes it more difficult to call on the flop witha
good but not amazing draw.

This is not meant to deter you from ever playing
suited connectors in single raised multiway pots.

And finally, the best speculative hands in multiway
pots are usually pocket pairs. They will almost
always make profitable calls preflop. Unlike suited
connectors and gappers, pocket pairs immediately
tell us on the flop whether weÅfre likely to have the
best hand by the river. When a set is flopped, we can
confidently raise and build the pot, and if the set is
missed, we can simply fold to any aggression from
our opponents. In other words, calling or raising on
the flop will usually either be highly profitable or
a clearly losing play. This isnÅft the case with suited
connectors since we'll usually only improve to the

Defending

In reality, all players won't defend an equal fraction
of their range against a bet. However, thereÅfs no
way to calculate exactly how much each player
should defend. It all comes down to positions and
how strong each playerÅfs range is. If a player is out
of position, has checked, and has shown weakness,
then itÅfs unlikely this person will defend much
against a bet. Conversely, if a player on the flop is
last to act in position and has a strong range, then
he should be expected to defend more aggressively
than everyone else.

To illustrate, suppose the cutoff opens and the
button and big blind both call. Since the big blind
received a 1 big blind discount on his preflop call
due to having posted the big blind, he will call as
long as he expects to lose less than 1 big bind overall
for the hand. This results in his range being weaker

than it would otherwise be. Furthermore, sinced:\work\kindle\holdem\559.png @@ heÅfs also out of position, heÅfll defend less on boards

Additionally, itÅfs important to note whether each

ItÅfs important to emphasize playing hands which

itÅfs important to understand how ranges should
change for shallow and deep stack play.

Tournament players need to know how to apply
different theory concepts based on stack depth
since players often start out quite deep before

Range

As stacks get deeper, itÅfs possible to bluff more
aggressively with a perfectly polarized range
and remain balanced. The reason for this is deep
stacks let us bet bigger and give our opponent a
worse price to call. This was already shown when
comparing raised pots to 3-bet pots since our flop
betting and raising range in 3-bet pots needed to
contain a higher fraction of value hands.

Recall that when analyzing flop play, we saw the
following street must be bet two-thirds of the time
after betting the pot with a perfectly polarized
range. ThatÅfs because our opponent was getting 2-

up, and the pot is 7 big blinds on the flop. This

the pot must grow on each street to get all-in on the

river.

So, if the pot must grow to be 2.25 times its

requires us to us to bet the turn 72 percent of the

have either 100 or 0 percent equity. Furthermore,
assume the pot is heads up and the turn and

to make nut type hands becomes less important

several reasons.

To illustrate, suppose the button opens and both
the small blind and big blind decide to defend
mostly by calling rather than 3-betting. When this
occurs, the button is nearly guaranteed to see a flop
or win preflop. Because the button will rarely face
a 3-bet, the blinds must defend with extremely
wide ranges to prevent the button from being able
to profitably open on any two cards. (In fact, it may
be possible for the button to profitably open with
any two cards if the blinds almost never 3-bet). This
results in the button being able to profitably open
with nearly any two cards and constantly getting to
play the flop in position.

So if the button is rarely 3-bet, heÅfll open nearly
any two cards in his range. This now gives the
blinds an incentive to 3-bet aggressively since
in order to prevent the blinds from being able to
profitably 3-bet any two cards the button must
call with a wide range. This results in the buttonÅfs

in 3-bet pots. There simply arenÅft enough strong
hands and worthwhile speculative hands in thed:\work\kindle\holdem\583.png @@ buttonÅfs opening range to defend at a reasonable

Consequently, itÅfs quite easy to show that if the
blinds are not aggressively 3-betting a button open,
then the button will have an incentive to open very
wide, which then gives the blinds an incentive to
start aggressively 3-betting (since the buttonÅfs
calling range is so weak).22 Although, as was already
shown in the preflop section, itÅfs impossible to
figure out exactly how wide the button should open
based on stack depth. For instance, if the button
opens over 50 percent of the time, heÅfll have to call
3-bets with some relatively weak hands. In other
words, while the button will open a bit wider since
position is more valuable in 3-bet pots when stacks
are deep, he won't open too wide or else heÅfll have to
defend too weak of range to a 3-bet.

23 As stakes get deep, positional advantage goes up. Thus, when
stacks are large, 3-betting out of position probably should not be
done as often as indicated here.

While itÅfs impossible to solve preflop play for 100
big blind stack depth, much less when stacks are
deeper, as a general rule of thumb, preflop ranges
will not change drastically when playing with large
stacks. The player likely to be in position, such as
the cutoff or the button, should call a bit wider ord:\work\kindle\holdem\584.png @@ open a bit more aggressively. Likewise, the blinds

itÅfs still critical that the blinds donÅft over adjust and
continue to 3-bet aggressively since if they do not,
the button especially can open with an extremely
wide range (and will thus be vulnerable to
aggressive 3-betting, which encourages the blinds
to change their strategy).

Additionally, be sure to keep in mind that just

In general, when stack sizes are shallow, even a
small change in stack depth will cause ranges and
frequencies to change drastically. Therefore, a
player who has studied the math behind shallow
stack play should have a significant advantage over
someone who has not. But when stacks are deep,
the changes will be much less severe.

In general, the absolute equity of a hand becomes
more important as stacks are shallow whereas the
ability to make nut type hands is more important
for deep stack play. When betting large, many bluffs
can be in our flop betting range for each very strong
value bet. Yet when stacks are shallow and bets are
smaller, our opponent gets a better price to his call
so more of our bets need to be value bets to keep
him indifferent to calling with a bluff catcher.

Introduction

As already discussed, since betting multiple sizes
in the same spot is best, optimal play requires us
to balance countless ranges at once. Furthermore,
while itÅfs sometimes possible to figure out close to
the perfect bet sizing for our specific hand on the
river, this is not possible on the flop or turn. ThatÅfs
because there are still cards left to come and our
betting range will never be perfectly polarized.

Nevertheless, we can employ the theory weÅfve
already discussed to greatly improve our bet
sizing. As is often the case when applying theory
to complex spots, while it may be impossible to tell
if our sizing is correct, itÅfs often possible to tell if
our sizing is wrong. Perhaps most importantly, we
can make sure our bet sizing is consistent with our
theoretical knowledge and there is no contradiction
in our thought process.

Furthermore, although our bet sizing will never be
perfect, there are many common spots where nearly
all players currently size their bets incorrectly andd:\work\kindle\holdem\591.png @@ fixing this leak will give us a significant edge. These

to Check

for Contradicting
Thoughts

Perhaps the most useful aspect of exploring
multiple bet sizes is that it allows us to check for
contradictions in our thought process. This can be
accomplished by making assumptions regarding
our opponent's calling range and then making
sure our bet size makes sense in context of those
assumptions.

Note that one assumption weÅfll commonly make
on the river is our opponent should defend at a
frequency that makes us indifferent to bluffing.
ThatÅfs because if he defends too often, our bluffs
will have a negative expected value and we'll stop
bluffing. And if he doesnÅft defend enough, we'll
never check-fold or check back in position with a
hand which has no showdown value. While there

are spots where bluffing any two cards on the riverd:\work\kindle\holdem\593.png @@ should be profitable, this usually is not the case.
Thus, this assumption is very useful for allowing us
to determine what bet sizes and frequencies make
sense.

HereÅfs an example. On the river, the pot is 50 big
blinds, we have 75 big blinds remaining, and believe
our opponent will call at a frequency which keeps
us indifferent to bluffing. If we're in position and go
all-in, our opponent should call 40 percent of the
time.

(50)(1X) (75)(X) =0>
X =04

Since he will call our jam 40 percent of the time,
going all-in on the river with the nuts has an
expected value of 30 big blinds greater than the
current pot size (ignore removal effects).

(30) = (0.4)(75) + (0.6)(0)
where
0.4 is the calling frequency,
75 is the bet size,
0.6 is the folding frequency, and
O is the amount won relative to checking when
our opponent folds.

This tells us that in order for betting any bet size
other than all-in to be correct with the nuts, our
opponent must call and raise enough so that ourd:\work\kindle\holdem\594.png @@ expected value is at least 30 big blinds greater than

balancing purposes.Åh But this is never theoretically
correct. So in this case, if a smaller bet doesnÅft have
an expected value of at least 30 big blinds, always
jam.

LetÅfs continue to develop this example. Suppose we

no hands should have improved in our opponentÅfs
range, and because the turn board texture was risky
to slowplay since his betting range included so
many draws, heÅfs unlikely to have a hand stronger
than ace-jack.

When first beginning to explore different bet sizes,
itÅfs easy to begin recklessly overbetting in spots
like this with bluffs since our opponentÅfs range is
capped. While itÅfs true he should hate facing and:\work\kindle\holdem\595.png @@ overbet from us if we bet the river with a balanced
range (since heÅfll always have at best a bluff catcher
and will be indifferent to calling), there arenÅft
enough strong hands in our range to allow us to bet
all our bluffs and remain balanced. In other words,
bluffing too aggressively on the river allows our
opponent to profitably call with his bluff catchers.

Stated another way, our opponent should not often
let us profitably bluff on the river with any two
cards even if overbets are effective. ThatÅfs because
our turn betting range was designed to check-fold
some missed bluffs on the river, and because of this,
itÅfs usually safe to assume our opponent should call
at a frequency that keeps us indifferent to bluffing.

ItÅfs tempting to use the river bet sizing formula
and calculate our bet sizing based on how often
we're beat on the river, which results in us
overbetting all our hands better than king-jack
and betting smaller with hands our opponent
sometimes has beat. However, doing this causes
our range to be transparent and allows him to
aggressively raise since our range is capped.

For instance, suppose we use the river bet sizing
equation and believe itÅfs best to bet 40 percent
of the pot with king-jack and balance it with the
proper amount of bluffs. Yet if the only value handd:\work\kindle\holdem\596.png @@ in our range is king-jack, our opponent will check-
raise all-in with all of his ace-jack and king-jack
hands since these holdings cannot be beat. (He'll
also raise bluffs of course.) Put differently, if we ever
bet the river with a range where our strongest value
bet is king-jack or weaker, then he'll be able to raise
aggressively since our range is capped.

So we can clearly see it is problematic to bet with
a range where the strongest value hand is weaker
than king-jack since our opponent can raise us
knowing he canÅft be beat. Furthermore, if he were
to always raise our small bets when he has ace-jack
or king-jack, then betting small with our nut type
hands would be more profitable than going all-in.
And in order for this to make sense theoretically, on
the river we must sometimes make small bets with
our nut type hands so our opponent is indifferent to
calling or raising our bet with his strongest hands.
This results in him sometimes raising and other
times calling.

Consequently, if we should occasionally value bet
small with the nuts and go all-in other times, then
the expected value of both lines must be equal.

And since we already know the expected value of
jamming the nuts for 75 big blinds into a 50 big
blind pot is 30 big blinds greater than the size of thed:\work\kindle\holdem\597.png @@ pot, thatÅfs what our expected value must also be if
both sizes should be used. Again, if our opponent
doesnÅft defend aggressively enough against our
small bets, then we should never bet small with the
nuts. In contrast, if he defends too aggressively, we
should always bet small since betting this size is
more profitable than overbetting.

Continuing on, letÅfs stick with assuming, on the
river with the nuts, we sometimes want to bet 40
percent of the pot since this will balance a betting
range which consists primarily of king-jack and
bluffs. And if the pot is 50 big blinds, a 40 percent
pot size bet will be 20 big blinds which means our
opponent should defend 71.4 percent of the time
against this bet to keep us indifferent to bluffing.

(50)(1 X) (20)(X) =0>
X =0.714

But if using two bet sizes with the nuts makes
sense, he should also raise at a frequency which
keeps us indifferent to making a small bet or large
bet. And if our opponent always raises all-in for
75 big blinds when he raises, the correct jamming
frequency to keep us indifferent to betting 20 or 75
big blinds is 26 percent.

(20)(0.714X) +(75)(X)

20 is the bet sizing,
0.714 is his minimum defending frequency,

We can thus conclude that our opponent needs to
raise our small bet 26.0 percent of the time to keep
us indifferent to overbetting and betting 40 percent
of the pot with the nuts. In other words, if he wants
to give us an incentive to bet small with the nuts,
that is how aggressively heÅfll need to raise.

All of this information may seem overwhelming
at first and we've only scratched the surface of bet
sizing. But itÅfs crucial not to make river bet sizing
out to be simpler than it is. This is especially true
when in position since betting small reopens the
betting and gives our opponent the opportunity to
check-raise. However, we believe itÅfs also important
to understand the mathematical significance of the
statements in order to check for a contradiction in
our thought process. In reality, most players are not
raising small bets nearly aggressively enough to
