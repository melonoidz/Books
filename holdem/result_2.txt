8. Hands in the small and big blind flatting range

the button opening range.

The weakest hand in the big blind calling range
will most likely be indifferent to calling and folding
preflop. This means the hand has an expected value
of approximately -1 big blind against the button
opening range. We will know we're at a possible
equilibrium when the weakest hand in the button
opening range is indifferent to opening and folding,
and the weakest hands in the big blind and small
blind flatting ranges are indifferent to calling and
folding.

We now have the opportunity to make a long and
cumbersome equation (which canÅft be solved) to
try to find the expected value of a button open.
However, instead of doing this, we'll use a less
precise but more practical equation to try to figured:\work\kindle\holdem\103.png @@ out what button opening and blind defending

This problem would be solvable if we knew the

button opening range when called. Unfortunately,
there is no way for us to get this value. We would
practically (quite possibly even literally) need
to solve the entire game of poker to get this
information.

Yet there are still ways this equation can be useful.
We can start by plugging in values for commonly
used ranges to solve for the unknown. If the ranges
look reasonable, we can attempt to use them
against good opponents while continuing to refine
them through trial and error.

LetÅfs start by designing what we think are
theoretically reasonable 3-betting ranges. We knowd:\work\kindle\holdem\104.png @@ the 3-bet percentage from the blinds must be less
than 37.5 combined, and at least 43 percent of the
3-bets must be defended against 4-bets. Hence, a
good starting point is a 3-betting range from the
blinds which consist of 5 percent value hands (TT
+, AJs+, AQo+) and 7.5 percent bluffs. This brings
the total 3-bet percentage to 12.5 percent in each
position.

This is a pretty standard 3-betting range many
good players use. Since 40 percent of the 3-betting
range consists of strong hands, itÅfs not hard to
defend at least 43 percent of the range to a 4-bet by
mixing in some calls and 5-bet bluffs. If the small
blind and big blind each 3-bet 12.5 percent of the
time, then the button will be 3-bet 23.4 percent of
the time total.

0.234 =1-(0.875)*

LetÅfs also assume the small blind and big blind call
10 and 20 percent of the time respectively when
there is no 3-bet. This means either one or both
positions will call approximately 24.3 percent of
the time.

0.243 = (0.1)(0.875) + (0.2)(0.775)

folds to the button open.

We now have enough values to plug into our
equation. If we defend the blinds this way, letÅfs see
how much money we expect the button to win or
lose on average when he opens with the worst hand
in his opening range if heÅfs to remain indifferent.

(0.243)(X) is the EV when button is called, and
(1-0.234 - 0.243)(1.5) is the EV when both blinds
fold.
That is, the button expects to lose on average 0.82
big blinds when the worst hand in his opening
range gets called if heÅfs to remain indifferent.

Now letÅfs interpret the significance of this value.
When the button open is called by just one of the
blinds, he gets to see in position a flop of either 5.5
or 6 big blinds. And if he expects an average result
to be -0.82 big blinds, his expectation is to get back
only 1.68 big blinds from the pot. Does this value
seem reasonable?

While I by no means know the exact correct
answer, my opinion is no! The blinds both haved:\work\kindle\holdem\106.png @@ fairly wide calling ranges and the button will

of only 1.68 big blinds is less than one-third of an

have an expectation greater than this. Therefore,
this leads me to believe the blinds are not 3-betting
and/or calling as aggressively as they need to be
with the values we used.

wonderfully shows how despite the fact that
we're often very restricted on what we can prove
theoretically, we can check our thought process
for contradictions as well as make models and
ask ourselves ÅgDo these ranges seem reasonable?Åh
Theory is much better at showing us when
something must be wrong than when something
must be correct. This means theory can be used to
estimate what are likely reasonable ranges and then
slowly improve them over time as well as adjust
them to exploit our specific opponents as needed.d:\work\kindle\holdem\107.png @@ ItÅfs also important to stress the difficulty of
explaining theory in a methodical and efficient

to cover.

For instance, you might ask, ÅgWell, whatÅfs the

defending ranges we used are wrong, only rather
that the button can open an extremely wide range

equation. More advanced readers should feel free to

Aslightly more complex formula which plugs
indifferent values for a big blind and small blind

Before moving on, letÅfs use the formula one more
time with different values. We'll assume the small

be some dead money in the pot and he has the

 Designing

Defending Ranges To
Maximizing EV

Although the previous concept showed us how to
examine if blind defending ranges look reasonable,
it did not address what hands go into each of
those ranges. An oversimplified rule which many
beginning players often find useful is to raise strong
hands for value, call with hands not quite strong
enough to raise, bluff raise hands just not strong
enough to call, and fold the worst hands.

While this rule provides a simple starting point, it
also causes a couple of problems.d:\work\kindle\holdem\111.png @@ 1. It encourages players to think hands can

accurately be ranked from strongest to

weakest based on their equity alone.

2. It does not take into account that the

opponentÅfs range will change based on what
line we take and this causes the equity of
our hands to change. For this reason, hands
which work best as calls donÅft always have
more equity than hands which work best as

bluff raises.

Since a game theoretically optimal player
will always take the line which maximizes his
expectation, we should be 3-betting and cold
calling with the hands which work well in those
ranges. No simple rule will suffice, and this requires
us to always be aware of what our opponentÅfs range
consists of and how calling, betting, and raising all
impact that range.

LetÅfs continue with designing blind defending
ranges when facing a button open. When we call
in the big blind against a button open, we'll almost
always play against a wide range for a small pot.
This means our calling range should put mored:\work\kindle\holdem\112.png @@ emphasis on flatting with hands which make

The most obvious hands to call a button open
with in the big blind will be suited hands such as
king-ten, queen-ten, queen-jack, and king-nine. Of
course, other types of hands will be needed in the
flatting range, but all of these can make good pairs
on the flop which do well against a wide opening
range.

While these hands do well in small raised pots,
they will be much trickier to play in 3-bet pots.
ThatÅfs because 3-betting results in our opponentÅfs
flop range being much stronger, and itÅfs often
difficult, when out of position, to play top pair with
a mediocre kicker for a large pot. So calling preflop
with hands like the K#9 @ and Q#T @is probably
best since this keeps our opponentÅfs range wide and
allows us to frequently have the better kicker when
we make a pair.

Continuing on, hands which work particularly
well as 3-bet bluffs are hands which have the
potential to make very strong hands by the river
and can be bluffed on the flop and turn effectively.
For example, hands like thed:\work\kindle\holdem\113.png @@ awe a

and rarely have trouble realizing their equity.

Often times we will 3-bet bluff a hand such as six-
five suited, which also could be profitably called
preflop. Although calling with a small suited
connector likely has a positive expectation, it often
makes weak pairs which won't win at showdown
ina raised pot. However, in 3-bet pots, where we
will have five outs to two pair and trips and will
occasionally win a massive pot, these pairs usually
work better.

Also notice that when our opponent has position,

position. Therefore, this allows us to 3-bet withd:\work\kindle\holdem\114.png @@ hands that do well in 3-bet pots even if they have to

Complex Ranges
 Balance

Few concepts in poker are as misunderstood and
misapplied as ÅgbalancingÅh a range. If our range is
not balanced, our opponent will often be able to
take extremely effective lines against that range. A
balanced range is the by-product of playing every
hand in our range in a way which maximizes, on
average, its expected value.

There will usually be some board textures which
favor our opponent's range more than ours no
matter how balanced our preflop range is. For
instance, if our range is much weaker than our
opponentÅfs, he will be able to make large bets at
a high frequency since he knows we'll rarely be

always 3-bets aces and ace-king preflop against a
cutoff open as most players do. This means that
when the button does not raise he will not have
many strong hands on king high flops and the
cutoff can then exploit him by making large bets
frequently on king high boards. Notice that itÅfs rare
for the button to have many hands stronger than
two kings with a queen kicker.

This means the button now has an incentive
to change strategy. Since he may win a large pot
when the flop comes king high and he holds aces
or ace-king, flatting those hands preflop is now
more profitable than 3-betting. In addition, by
flatting some strong hands preflop the button will
sometimes win a large pot when a player in the
blinds squeezes  reraises preflop.

Now once the cutoff notices the button has aces
and ace-king in his range on king high flops, he
should start betting less aggressively, and these
adjustments back and forth eventually lead both

We may run into a similar problem if we never
flat any strong hands in the small blind. If this is
the case, our range will become quite vulnerable
to squeezes from the big blind. Also notice that the
big blind does not have this problem since no one
can squeeze after he calls. While the big blindÅfs cold
calling range is condensed  no very strong hands
 the flop will usually put some two pairs and
sets in the big blinds range before the button can
capitalize on this.

For this reason, it may make sense to put some
strong hands in the small blind flatting range. We
cannot prove this, and it may be the case that the
small blind should almost always fold to a squeeze
and expect the button to do most of the defending.

Another option is to estimate the big blindÅfs
expected value when we call his 3-bet bluff and
then design the defending ranges accordingly.
HereÅfs an example. We expect the big blind will on
average lose 5.5 big blinds when the weakest 3-bet
bluff in his range is called. This means he will get
on average 3 big blinds back from the 18 big blind
pot. This estimate may seem low, but as will be
shown in the hand chart, the worst hand in the big
blind 3-betting range is very weak. That is, it makes
sense to expect the big blind to rarely be in a highly
profitable spot post-flop when heÅfs out of position
with the weakest hand in his 3-betting range.

Furthermore, letÅfs assume that when facing a 3-bet
on the button, we will 4-bet 5 percent of the total
hands we're dealt. This is a reasonable estimate if
we use a small 4-bet sizing with a range of KK-JJ, AK,
and bluffs. This results in us 4-betting 11.1 percent
of the time we face a 3-bet.

We can repeat this process and instead assume
our opponent's bluffs only lose 4.5 big blinds when
they are called. The same math as above will show
we then need to defend 30.7 instead of 27.5 percent
of our opening range by calling. Remember, these
calls are in addition to the 4-bets, so we are in total
defending around 40 percent of the hands we open
preflop when we face a 3-bet.

Notice all of these button flatting ranges include
aces. Aces have a strong removal effect and are
unlikely to be outdrawn by the opponent on the
flop. (We can always raise the flop and turn if the
board is particularly threatening.) Aces make
a strong hand on board textures which would
otherwise miss our flatting range and because of
this, I believe there is more value in flatting aces
than 4-betting them preflop. Kings and queens
could also be called preflop, but since these hands
fear overcards, they are more risky to slowplay.

Also notice how wide the buttonÅfs 3-bet flatting
range quickly becomes once the button is opening
over 50 percent of the hands. Weak pocket pairs and
low suited connectors get placed in the 3-bet calling
range even if we assume a low expected value on
the flop for our opponent's 3-bet bluffs. Specifically,
assuming our opponentÅfs worst 3-bet bluff losesd:\work\kindle\holdem\128.png @@ less than 5.5 big blinds when called, we will need
to start calling with weak suited aces and suited
kings, hands that are going to be difficult to play
effectively post-flop, especially against a polarized
range.

As mentioned previously, one of the biggest
problems when designing 3-bet calling ranges is
as the range gets wider, the big blindÅfs 3-bet bluffs
also get more profitable opportunities post-flop.
While it may be possible the expected value of a
weak 3-bet bluff will only be on average 3 big blinds
on the flop against a very strong range, as the 3-bet
calling range gets wider, itÅfs going to become more
difficult to prevent the 3-bettor from profitably
bluffing his weak hands. When flatting against
3-bets with hands as weak as the 5@4@ andthe
334, itÅfs unlikely the big blind will lose 5.5 big
blinds or more when the worst 3-bet in his range is
called. Again, thatÅfs because the defending range is
so weak.

This suggests itÅfs unlikely the buttonÅfs opening
range should be exceptionally wide for a 2.5 big
blind open. ItÅfs simply too difficult to defend against
3-bets on the button once we are opening over half
the hands weÅfre dealt preflop. Some players may
disagree with this, but if they do, they must eitherd:\work\kindle\holdem\129.png @@ be comfortable defending an extremely wide range
against 3-bets or believe the opponent's 3-bet bluffs
will only rarely get into profitable spots post-flop.
In reality, this is most likely the opposite of what
many good players think. ThatÅfs because the best
players at a given stake can open the button much
wider than they should theoretically be able to
since they are more skilled than their opponents. In
addition, itÅfs much easier to make mistakes when
out of position than in position which further
reinforces the superior playerÅfs advantage.
Likewise, mediocre players look at how the best
players play and try to mimic them. If the biggest
winners are able to open 70 percent of their hands
on the button, many mediocre players will copy
them and it won't take long before itÅfs generally
accepted among poker players to open the button
much wider than is theoretically correct. Mob
mentality is alive and well in the poker community,
and it gets increasingly difficult to improve asa
player when one finds themselves no longer able
to simply copy what other successful players are
doing.d:\work\kindle\holdem\130.png @@ Understanding
Complex Ranges 

Defending Against
4-Bets

One of the more difficult aspects of preflop play
is deciding how to defend against 4-bets. WeÅfve
already discussed how conceptually it can make
sense to flat against a 4-bet both in and out of
position, so we won't repeat that here. Nevertheless,
deciding how to handle a 4-bet is a difficult concept
to approach and often there is no clear answer.

We will now attempt to analyze possible ways to
defend against button 4-bets after3-betting from
the blinds. There are two general ways to approach
this problem:

1. Design our 3-betting range so that every

hand can comfortably 5-bet jam or fold

when facing a 4-bet. This allows us to avoidd:\work\kindle\holdem\131.png @@ playing large pots out of position, but
makes small 4-bets very effective against

us.
2. Defend some hands against 4-bets by
calling and other hands by 5-betting. This

allows us to call when our opponent gives us
excellent odds and is likely the best line
with hands like king-queen suited which
we do not want to fold but cannot effec-
tively 5-bet.

Also, when calling a 4-bet, itÅfs important to
remember that the call only needs to be profitable
relative to folding which results in losing 9.5 big
blinds overall for the hand. So calling the 4-bet
will have a positive expected value as long as we
expect to lose, on average, less than this amount. In
addition, this allows us to check-fold the flop at a
high frequency since we are just trying to lose less
than 9.5 big blinds overall for the hand.

After calling a 4-bet out of position, we are likely
not going to be able to prevent our opponent from
being able to profitably bet any two cards on the
flop. When his 4-bet bluff is called, heÅfll have
already invested 19.5 big blinds preflop, so allowingd:\work\kindle\holdem\132.png @@ him to make a profitable bet post-flop with any two
cards is not a problem. ThatÅfs because he'll still lose
money by 4-bet bluffing too weak of hands preflop
despite the fact that he can often make profitable
bluffs post-flop.

For example, suppose we fold enough to our
opponentÅfs flop bet in a 4-bet pot that his expected
value is +5 big blinds when he bets any two cards
on the flop. When he has no equity on the flop, heÅfll
still expect to lose on average 14.5 big blinds total
for the hand.

-14.5=5-19.5
where
19.5 big blinds is how much money heÅfs investing
into the pot to get the profitable post-flop
opportunity, and
5 big blinds is the expected value of our
opponent's bet post flop.

Finally, if our opponent notices our 4-bet calling
range is weak, heÅfll start betting on the flop at a
high frequency. This makes slowplaying, as we
did before by flatting 3-bets from the blinds with
aces on the button, some very strong hands, such
as the just mentioned aces, more profitable than 5-
betting. We already utilized this strategy earlier.d:\work\kindle\holdem\133.png @@ Although we understand the theory behind 4-bet
flatting ranges well at this point, there are a few
practical problems with designing and using the
ranges. The first is even if we use a very aggressive
3-betting range, we will still have relatively few
hand combinations in our 4-bet flatting range and
5-betting range. This often requires us to put the
same hand in both a 4-bet calling and 5-betting
range (and sometimes the folding range as well).
This makes designing the ranges quite difficult.

HereÅfs an example. The button opens and we 3-bet
in the big blind with the

If we have the best hand preflop and call the 4-

bet, we are out of position and quite likely to be
outdrawn or bluffed off the best hand on the

flop. Therefore, 5-betting is an option since the
holding blocks aces, queens, and ace-king in the
buttonÅfs 5-bet calling range, but ace-queen has less
equity when called than many suited connectors.
Arguments for both 5-betting and calling with ace-
queen can be made and itÅfs possible the hand goes

into both ranges.d:\work\kindle\holdem\134.png @@ Likewise, we may find if we are always flatting
a 4-bet with hands like ace-jack and king-queen,
that our calling range consists of too many of these
types of hands. Imagine what our 4-bet calling
range will look like if we call with all our ace-queen,
ace-jack, and king-queen hands. Since each hand
makes 16 combinations, this would result in our
4-bet calling range including 48 combinations of
these three hands, and this may make our range
too transparent enabling our opponent to play
extremely effectively against us. ThatÅfs because
he will know we often have many strong but not
amazing hands on ace and queen high boards.

So to avoid having too transparent of a range,
this likely requires us to flat 4-bets with a few
combinations of suited connectors. And if we
are flatting only a few combinations of suited
connectors, we must believe the expected value
of flatting and folding (as well as possibly even 5-
betting) is approximately equal.

Finally, we must also remember that neither our
opponents nor ourselves are capable of playing
theoretically optimally post-flop. With this in
mind, who do you think is more likely to make a
mistake in a 4-bet pot, the player who is in position
with a polarized range, or the player out of positiond:\work\kindle\holdem\135.png @@ with a condensed range? Remember, a polarized
range in position is much easier to play, so this
encourages players to minimize flatting 4-bets
out of position when possible unless they are very
confident with their post-flop play.

For these reasons, itÅfs not likely a productive use
of time to attempt to design and memorize 4-
bet calling ranges. They are simply too difficult
to develop precisely since there are probably
many hands which have approximately the same
expected value taking different lines. It would
instead be wiser to know what hands are reasonable
to flat 4-bets without of position and then
consider calling with those hands against the right
opponents.d:\work\kindle\holdem\136.png @@ Recommended
Hand Chart

The following hand chart was created with one
of my poker friends, Nick Howard. These ranges
assume a 3.5 big blind open in all positions except
for the button where it is 2.5 big blinds. While far
from perfect, these ranges are reasonable for players
to examine and use against strong opponents if
they donÅft want to spend the time creating their
own.

In addition, while a small change in bet sizing
will not greatly impact most ranges, the smaller
the opening sizing, the more aggressively the
remaining players must defend. If the open is 3
big blinds, the remaining positions will have to
defend more aggressively than if the open is to 3.5
big blinds. Likewise, if we use a smaller opening
size, we should be able to open a bit wider, but as
implied, our opponents will be able to call more
hands profitably from the blinds and elsewhere.

ItÅfs also worth pointing out that I chose to defend
very aggressively from the blinds against a button
open, much more than most players are probablyd:\work\kindle\holdem\137.png @@ use to. In fact, the button must win on average

0.74 big blinds when his worse open is called for
him to break even. Yet since most all the calls will
come from the big blind, who, with the worse hand
in his calling range, is only trying to lose less than

1 big blind overall, I think this is best. However,
newer players should likely defend less aggressively
since playing out of position with a weak range is
difficult.

Finally, note that many percentages are rounded
or estimates, and to make a more accurate and
detailed hand chart is quite difficult and can
quickly become cluttered. In addition, the bluffs
listed are meant to give a sense of the type of bluffs
which are reasonable for that position. They are not
in the sense that these are the only recommended
bluffing hands. In fact, if we only bluffed with these
hands, our range might be come too transparent.

Preflop is far from solved and while strong preflop
play is critical to success in no-limit hold Åfem, itÅfs
much more important to have a general sense of
what types of hands go into what ranges and to
understand why rather than memorize specific
ranges. So donÅft needlessly spend time memorizing
