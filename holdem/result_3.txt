Introduction

Post-flop bet sizing is one of the most complex
concepts in no-limit hold Åfem, and as such itÅfs often
ignored since itÅfs difficult to tell where to even
begin . And while weÅfre nowhere near ready to
start discussing bet sizing in detail, itÅfs crucial that
the fundamentals are understood before moving
forward.

This concept especially can be made as difficult
and complex as one wishes, and itÅfs important not
to hold ourselves to an unrealistic standard when
beginning to discuss bet sizing. However, whatÅfs
most important now is to understand the general
factors which help determine whether to bet large
or small relative to the size of the pot.

Lastly, note that more precise bet sizing will
usually be possible when there are fewer cards left
to come. As will be explained in ÅgPinpointing the

Bet Sizing at a Glance

Although bet sizing is too complex of a concept to
confine to a single chapter, we should first make
sure to understand the basic mathematics behind
it before moving onto post-flop play. ThatÅfs because
bet sizing is extremely important in no-limit hold
Åfem, and what often separates a great player from
merely a good one is how he uses different bet sizes
indifferent situations to manipulate his opponentÅfs
range. Specifically, an excellent bet size can
force our opponent to make tough decisions and
maximizes the expected value of the bettorÅfs hand.

In theory, if a player has a perfectly polarized range
which includes hands of either 100 percent equity
(the pure nuts) or 0 percent equity (pure air), he will
choose his bet sizing so that heÅfs betting an equal
fraction of the pot on all three streets and is all in by
the river. A formal proof of the mathematics behind
this will not be shown here, but it was solved for
in The Mathematics of Poker by Bill Chen and Jerrod
Ankenman. So itÅfs important to understand that ad:\work\kindle\holdem\154.png @@ player with a completely polarized range will use
this bet sizing structure to get all the money in by
the river to maximize his earnings.
Final pot - size = (Starting pot -size)(Pot growth rate) "=" Reman)
LetÅfs see how this formula works. Suppose itÅfs blind
versus blind and weÅfll assume on the flop that the
small blind has a range which includes only hands
with either 100 percent or 0 percent equity. For a
3.5 big blind open, the starting pot-size on the flop
will be 7 big blinds, the final pot-size will be 200 big
blinds, and there are three streets remaining. This
reduces the following pot growth rate equation
200 =(7)(R)?
where
7 is the starting pot size,
200 is the final pot size, and
Ris the pot growth rate.
This implies that the pot growth rate is 3.06.

ie, 3

3.06-(2Åã)
7

Therefore, the pot should increase to 3.06 times its
size with each passing street. This means we must
bet 1.03 pot-sized bets on the flop, turn, and river to
get all the money in by the river.d:\work\kindle\holdem\155.png @@ SPS +(2)(Bet Size) = (3.06)(SPS) >
(2)(Bet Size) = (2.06)(SPS) =>
Bet Size =(1.03)(SPS)
where
SPS is the starting pot size.

And for this example, we should bet 7.2 big blinds
on the flop, 22.0 big blinds on the turn, and 68.1 big
blinds on the river to get all the money in.

Since these perfectly polarized ranges do exist,
understanding optimal bet sizing for them is
important, but the vast majority of the time a
betting range will not be perfectly polarized.
Usually, our opponent will have some hands in his
range which either already beat our value hands or
can outdraw us, and likewise, our bluffs will usually
be capable of improving to a strong hand. So when
this is the case, betting an equal fraction of the pot
on each street will not usually be ideal.

Stated another way, when our opponent has
several hands in his range stronger than some of
our value betting hands, we'll only occasionally
want to get all the money in by the river. ThatÅfs
because our large bet sizing on each street will
encourage our opponent to fold all but his strongest
hands by the river. That is, whenever we value
bet each street only to discover that our opponentd:\work\kindle\holdem\156.png @@ has called us down with a better hand, we'll lose

a large pot. This is one reason why in single raised
pots with 100 big blind stacks, the majority of the
time we will not bet big enough to try to get all the
money in by the river.

However, there are other situations we may still
want to bet even if our opponent has few medium
strength hands in his range. This will frequently
happen if, when in position, we call one of our
opponentÅfs bets and he checks to us on a later street
that did not improve any hands in his range. We
may want to bet in an attempt to win the hand right
there.

To illustrate this concept, suppose our opponent
opens in the cutoff and we call on the button. He
continuation bets the

flop and then checks to us when the 2 Åë comes

on the turn. While our opponent may have some
marginal hands in his range, such as tens and nines,
the majority of his range should be weak. Therefore,
a small bet should prevent him from seeing a free
river card with his weak hands. And because itÅfsd:\work\kindle\holdem\157.png @@ small, it should also minimize the effectiveness

of any potential check-raise whereas betting large
makes a turn check-raise more effective and allows
him to defend less of his turn checking range.

When our strong hands are susceptible to being
outdrawn on later streets, we may choose to use
a descending bet sizing structure. That is, by
betting bigger on earlier streets, we make sure
our opponent puts more money into the pot
when heÅfs behind if he wants to try to outdraw us.
Nevertheless, there are still limits on how big our
bet sizing can be since very large bets are punished
harshly when our opponent does have a hand
which already is better than ours.

HereÅfs an example. We open in the cutoff with the
JvTv and only the button calls. The flop is the
T #7446 andthe turn is the 2 Åë, Since we have top
pair, we may decide to bet a larger fraction of the
pot on the flop than on the turn. Despite our hand
not being especially strong, by betting larger on
the flop, we make our opponent fold some overcard
hands with over 25 percent equity. However, his
implied odds and equity will have decreased on a
low turn card, and by betting small, on the turn, we
hopefully end the hand here, but if he does call, his
range still should not be too strong on the river.d:\work\kindle\holdem\158.png @@ And when we go ahead and bet the river, our bet
will often be small (after betting the turn). Our
opponent has no additional implied odds and weÅfre
not worried about being outdrawn with his weak
hands. In fact, as will be shown in future chapters,
when out of position on the river, there is not much
difference between betting small and checking.

So while deciding what bet size is best in a given
situation will often be quite difficult, we should
always remember the most important underlying
concepts. Large bets, on average, require our
opponent to defend less frequently and put more
money into the pot while small bets require him to
defend more. But small bets also require the bettor
to be bluffing less since the defender is getting a
better price. Therefore, the choice will often be
between betting small and giving our opponent a
good price when he'll call with a wide weak range or
betting big so he gets a worse price and calls witha
strong range.

Acommon misconception players have is the
belief that they need to have one specific bet sizing
with their entire range in each particular spot. This
is not the case. ItÅfs possible to have several different
bet sizings in the same spot where each range is
balanced. Furthermore, a player who is capable ofd:\work\kindle\holdem\159.png @@ using multiple bet sizings will have a significant
edge on someone who restricts himself to only a
single sizing.

This idea of using multiple bet sizes in the same
spot to manipulate our opponent's range is usually
theoretically correct and extremely important in
many spots. For instance, if, on the river, the pot is
80 big blinds and we have 100 big blinds remaining,
our bet with one range could be for the whole 100
big blinds, 60 big blinds with another range, and
40 big blinds with a third range. Each of these
ranges could be perfectly balanced and designed to
manipulate our opponent's calling range in the way
that best fits our purpose.

We should now have a strong enough
understanding of the theory behind bet sizing
to proceed to post-flop play. And as bet sizing
is discussed in more detail, we'll learn how to
recognize when certain bet sizings make sense.
Thus, we'll be able to exploit weak opponents who
use senseless bet sizings while preventing strong
opponentÅfs from exploiting us.d:\work\kindle\holdem\160.png @@ Summary

Although excellent bet sizing is one of the most
difficult skills to master, itÅfs critical for success
against tough opponents. Specifically, betting
the right size manipulates our opponent's calling
range to get calls from weaker hands but still
make some high equity hands folds. While we
have only scratched the surface of this topic, by
understanding who has the polarized range and
what our bets are designed to accomplish, the
foundation has been laid for developing precise bets
in future chapters.

Here are some of the important points:

1. Betting equal fractions of the pot on all three

We are now ready to move on to post-flop play.
While itÅfs certainly possible to play solid poker
preflop simply by memorizing a hand chart, this

many different flop combinations. But an excellent

So this is an important section of the book, and
we'll start our post-flop analysis by examining
how to defend against a flop bet when in position.
In addition, by examining how to defend against a
bet when in position, we'll also be able to see what
types of hands our opponent should continuation
bet and use this as a starting point for deciding
whether to check or bet when positions are

When out of position, our opponent should only

range is designed to play effectively against our

be some board textures on which he can profitably
bet the worst hands in his range, more often than
not our opponent will need to have a certain type
of hand to be able to make a profitable bluff out of
position.

So to start, letÅfs first examine how often we would
have to fold to a flop bet before our opponent can
profitably bet two unwinnable cards To help do this,
the following equation shows, in terms of pot-sized
bets, how often a bluff needs to suceed to assure

We now want to ask how much better is it for our
opponent when he bluffs the worst hand in his
betting range (on the flop) and we defend by callingd:\work\kindle\holdem\168.png @@ instead of raising?Åh This is what we did for preflop
scenarios.

First, notice that our opponent will almost never
be bluffing with hands which have no equity,
so his bluffs should have an expected value of
greater than 0 when they are called. However, the
difference between post-flop and preflop is our
opponent gets to see three more random cards
when we call preflop, but only one more random
card when we call post-flop. That is, on the flop,
each player goes from having access to two cards to
having access to five cards, and many hands greatly
changed in strength. On the turn, each player goes
from five to six cards, and while many hands will
change in strength, this effect is not usually as
drastic as it was when we saw a flop.

In other words, while there was a significant
difference between calling and raising against the
weakest hands in our opponents preflop range, this
difference is less significant post-flop. That is, many
of the weakest hands in a preflop raising range
which would fold to a 3-bet can make sets, two
pairs, flush draws, and straight draws when allowed
to see a flop. But on the flop, our opponent will often
be bluffing with hands which canÅft immediately
make a strong hand on any turn card.d:\work\kindle\holdem\169.png @@ HereÅfs an example. Our opponent will often bluff

while a favorable turn which gives this player a
straight or flush draw almost certainly will allow
him to make a profitable bet, this spot is not nearly
as profitable as simply making a strong hand on the
flop.

There are flop textures where our opponent will
be much more likely to outdraw us when his worst
bluff is called. And in these cases there is a large
difference in his expectation when he faces a calld:\work\kindle\holdem\170.png @@ rather than a raise. So on these board textures, we
must defend more aggressively.

HereÅfs an example. The flop is the Tv8 7 and
our opponent bets. It should be clear there is a
reasonable chance he outdraws us. ThatÅfs because
even his weakest bluffs can turn two pair, trips,
straights, or a pair higher than tens. In addition,
even if we call with the nut straight on the turn,
our opponent may be betting the flop with a heart
and catch running hearts on the turn and river. (Of
course, this assumes we would only call with the
nut straight on a heart turn so our opponent gets to
realize his equity).

Consequently, we can conclude that since the

should defend when we're calling instead of raising.

57.1 percent of our hands to stop our opponent

range. Nevertheless, we cannot solve for the exact
frequency for defending against this bet.

So the conclusion is that defending anywhere
between 60 to 70 percent of the time on mostd:\work\kindle\holdem\171.png @@ boards seems like a reasonable guess. This should
stop our opponent from profitably betting any two
cards on the flop. It also allows for enough folding
that we give our opponent an incentive to bluff

can recklessly bluff any two cards. Likewise, we
are not defending so aggressively that we give too
much value to our opponentÅfs strong hands. And
throughout this book, the advice given will usually
be to defend at least 60 percent of the time on the
flop, but players who are more advanced should try
to defend a bit more aggressively than this.

Usually, the board textures where our opponentÅfs
bluffs can likely out draw us on the turn (such as
the Tv8w7@ flop mentioned earlier) are the same
ones where being in position is quite valuable. In
addition, on these type of flops, we should have
many hands which can improve on the turn.

Raising Ratio on the Flop

As discussed in ÅgPart Three: Post-Flop Bet Sizing,Åh
starting on page 89, there is no one size fits all bet
sizing on the flop when betting or raising if our
range isnÅft perfectly polarized. Nevertheless, there
are still some commonly used sizings which we
should be familiar with. For instance, in a single
raised pot, most players bet around 75 percent of
the pot which will usually be close to 6 big blinds
into an 8 big blind pot. Likewise, players who
raise will usually raise this bet to between 16 and
18 big blinds in position  a reasonable sizing
which allows the player in position to raise flops
aggressively and requires the bettor to defend
a large fraction of his flop bets by calling out of
position.

So if we raise a 6 big blind bet into an 8 big blind
pot to 16 big blinds, our opponent must defend atd:\work\kindle\holdem\174.png @@ least 47 percent of the time if he wants to prevent
us from making an immediate profit. Moreover, as
is usually the case, a small change in raise sizing
will not drastically impact this frequency. For
instance, a slightly larger raise to 18 big blinds
requires our opponent to defend 44 percent of
the time to prevent our raise from yielding an
immediate profit.

Our flop raising range will almost always be
polarized with strong made hands and bluffs. But
on some board textures, draws will be raised as well
since they will usually become either very strong
or very weak hands by the river, and can be value
bet or bluffed accordingly. Also note that by raising,
we make our opponentÅfs range much stronger on
the turn, so it makes little sense to raise a hand for
value unless itÅfs stronger than the vast majority
of the hands in our opponentÅfs flop betting range.
And since our raising range is polarized, many of
the hands in our opponentÅfs calling range should be
bluff catchers which beat our bluff raises but lose to
our value raises.

Now that we know what types of hands make
sense in our raising range, letÅfs figure out what our
value raising to bluff raising ratio should be on
the flop. For the sake of simplification, we'll alsod:\work\kindle\holdem\175.png @@ assume that our raising range is perfectly polarized
meaning that our hands have either 100 percent or
O percent equity.

So the first question is: ÅgWhat is the end goal of
our flop raising range?Åh Well, our goal on the river
should be to bet with a range consisting of the right
ratio of value bets and bluffs to make our opponent
indifferent to calling with his mediocre strength
hands. That is, a large fraction of our opponentÅfs
range on the river will be bluff catchers, and we
want the expected value of both calling and folding
with these hands to be zero.

LetÅfs pause for a moment and look at a different
example where the math is as simple as possible
so the main ideas can be understood. Suppose our
bet will always be the size of the pot. Furthermore,
suppose our range on the flop consists of two types
of hands, the nuts, which occur 20 percent of the
time and will never lose, and bluffs, which occur 80
percent of the time and which can never win. This
information can be used to determine what fraction
of our hands should be bet on the flop, turn, and
river.

When we bet the river, our opponent is getting
offered 2-to-1 odds to call our bet, and this requires
us to bluff one time for every two value bets, andd:\work\kindle\holdem\176.png @@ in this example, since 20 percent of our range on
the flop are the nuts (which are the value hands),
we'll be betting (on the river) 30 percent of the total

our opponent indifferent to calling and folding
since both calling and folding have an expected
value of zero. In addition, notice our strategy is
indifferent to what our opponent does with his
bluff catcher  if he calls every time, some of the
time, or none of the time, the expected value of our
betting range will be the same. This means we can
look at our river bet from the perspective that our
opponent always folds when we bet, and in this
example, that will happen 30 percent of the time

our opponent folds every time we bet, these are all
winning bets.

win after we check (on the river). ThatÅfs because it
also makes no sense for us to ever check the nuts

to-1 odds to call our bet, so he only needs to win one
out of every three times to call. But also remember
that all our river bluffs are in a sense winners, and
since (in this example) we win 30 percent of the

meaning that the remaining 27 , or approximately
70 percent, of our flop bets should be bluffs.

ThereÅfs another interesting fact that should be
pointed out. If you were to ask a typical poker
player how he should bet, many will tell you to bet
your good hands and then bluff a little. Of course
thereÅfs more to it than this, but on the river this
is roughly right. But it has now been shown that
on the flop, approximately 70 percent of our bets
should be bluffs,? and this will be counterintuitive
to many people. But this is accurate since there are
still two streets left. This concept is important to
solid theoretical play, so it must be understood well
before moving on. It may help to visualize this by
examining what hands are in each betting range.
So letÅfs once again repeat some of what has already
been covered.

9 Inthese cases where it seems likely that your opponent has a good
hand rather than a great hand or a draw and will likely at most call

hoping you won't bet again.d:\work\kindle\holdem\181.png @@ On the flop, itÅfs useful to imagine that our betting
range consists of four types of hands  flop bluffs,
turn bluffs, river bluffs, and value hands. A flop
bluff is a hand which will bluff on the flop but will
check-fold on the turn, while all of our turn bluffs,
river bluffs, and value hands will keep betting. Since
our opponent is being offered 2-to-1 odds on our
pot size flop bet, only two-thirds of our flop betting
range should continue betting on the turn. In other
words, our turn bluffs, river bluffs, and value bets
must make up two-thirds of our flop betting range
while only one-third of our range should be flop
bluffs which won't be bet on the next street if our
opponent calls.

Our turn betting range is similar to our flop betting
range except our flop bluffs are no longer in this
range as they will be check-folded. In other words,
the turn betting range consist of turn bluffs, river
bluffs, and value hands, but only river bluffs and
value hands will be bet on the river. Just as before,
two-thirds of our turn betting range should be bet
on the river, so river bluffs and value bets should
make up two-thirds of our turn betting range while
the remaining one-third should be turn bluffs.

Lastly, on the river, our betting range will consist
of only two types of hands, river bluffs and valued:\work\kindle\holdem\182.png @@ hands. As can clearly be seen, our betting range
now includes much fewer hands than it did on the
flop as all of our flop bluffs and turn bluffs have
been check-folded. And since our betting range
includes fewer bluffs but all of our value hands are
still being bet, the ratio of value bets to bluffs is now
significantly higher than it was on the flop or the
turn. This concept of bluffing less aggressively on
each following street consistently appears when
analyzing theoretical play.

ThereÅfs two more points that need to be made.

1. The size of the bet relative to the size of the pot
determines how often you bluff. So in our 20
percent value bet example, if we were to make
half-pot size bets instead of full pot size bets,
our opponent would be getting offered odds of
3-to-1 instead of 2-to-1. This means the river
should consist of 20 percent value bets and
6.67 percent river bluffs (for a total of 26.67
percent). The turn should be 20 percent value
bets, 6.67 percent river bluffs, and 8.89 percent
turn bluffs for a total of 35.56 percent. And the
flop should be 20 percent value bets, 6.67 per-

cent river bluffs, 8.89 percent turn bluffs, andd:\work\kindle\holdem\183.png @@ 11.85 percent flop bluffs (for a total of 47.41
percent).

2. ItÅfs also possible to have such a strong range
that there wonÅft be enough bluffs on an earlier
street. For instance, in our original example,
suppose there were 40 percent value bets and
we were again making pot-sized bets. Then
the betting range on the river would be 60 per-
cent, on the turn it would be 90 percent, and
on the flop it would be 135 percent. But since
itÅfs impossible to bet 135 percent of all hands,
it would just mean that all hands in the flop
range would be bet on the flop.

Now letÅfs return to the previous situation where
a bet sizing of 57 percent of the pot is going to be

utilized on the turn and river. In this situation, if we

bet 57 percent of the pot on the river, our opponent
will risk 0.57 pot sized bets to win 1.57 pot sized
bets. This requires 73 percent of our river bets to be
value bets.

And when we bet the turn for 57 percent of the pot,

our opponent once again risks0.57 pot sized bets to
win 1.57 pot sized bets. This means, when we bet,d:\work\kindle\holdem\184.png @@ he must effectively lose 73 percent of the time to be
indifferent to calling or folding, and this requires
us to bet the river 73 percent of the time to make
our opponent indifferent to calling on the turn.
(Remember, when we bet the river, our opponent
has effectively lost, but if we check, he will always
win). Since we need to bet the river 73 percent of
the time, and only 73 percent of our river bets need
to be value bets, 53 percent of our turn bets must be
for value.

(River Betting Frequency) (Percent of River Bets Which Are Value Bets) =

(0.73)(0.73) =0.53

Lastly, we must make sure weÅfre betting the
turn at the right frequency to keep our opponent
indifferent to calling our flop raise. If we raise a 6
big blind bet into an 8 big blind pot to 18 big blinds,
our opponent risks an additional 12 big blinds by
calling to win the 32 big blinds already in the pot.
Again, since our opponent always effectively loses
when we bet the following street but wins when we
check, we must bet the turn 73 percent of the time
after raising the flop. (Notice itÅfs again 73 percent
since our raise is approximately a 0.57 pot sized
raise.)

In other words, since weÅfre either raising or betting
57 percent of the pot on each street, we need to betd:\work\kindle\holdem\185.png @@ the turn 73 percent of the time, bet the river 73
percent of the time after betting the turn, and 73
percent of our river bets need to be value bets. We
can multiply these frequencies together to figure
out what percentage of our raises on the flop should
be value raises. That is, the percentage of raises on
the flop that need to be for value are determined by
the following equation:

(Turn Betting Frequency) (River Betting Frequency)
(Percent of River Bets Which Are Value Bets ) =(0.73) (0.73) (0.73)

which is the same as:

(0.73)Åã = 0.389
While the numbers are a bit different from those
in the previous example where we made pot size
bets, notice the concept of raising or betting all
our value hands on each street and removing some
bluffs from our range on each additional street is
still present. The majority of our flop bets are bluffs,
around half our turn bets are bluffs, and just over a
quarter of our river bets are bluffs. ThatÅfs because
some of our bluffs on the flop, i-e., flop bluffs, will
drop out of our betting range and check-fold on the
turn.

In reality, we'll never be raising the flop with a
perfectly polarized range. Our bluff raises willd:\work\kindle\holdem\186.png @@ sometimes get a lucky turn or river and improve
to strong hands, and likewise our value raises
will occasionally get an unlucky turn or river and
become weak hands. Therefore, itÅfs necessary to
take into account the fact that we'll often havea
different amount of strong hands on the river than
what was started with when we raised on the flop.
In addition, sometimes a value or bluff raise will
become a marginal hand on the turn or river. When
this occurs, it may be best to check back, especially
when in position, and attempt to win at showdown.
Notice that we will not always be able to bet all
three streets when our holding is best.
Lastly, if we fold to a turn bet, it might turn out
that the folded hand would have improved to
the best hand on the river, and if we bet the turn
and make our opponent fold, he might be folding
a hand which would have outdrawn us. Again,
keep in mind that position is very valuable. ThatÅfs
because the player in position has a much easier
time realizing the equity of his semi-bluffs than
the player out of position. Specifically, while our
opponent will often fold his weak hands when we
bet the turn, if our holding is weak, we can check
back the turn after raising the flop and occasionally

get lucky on the river.d:\work\kindle\holdem\187.png @@ LetÅfs now imagine a case where our value hands
have 80 percent equity and our semi-bluffs have
20 percent equity against our opponentÅfs calling

of equity for actual hands on the flop since gutshots
and weak pairs often have around 20 percent
equity. Furthermore, letÅfs assume we'll always bet
the best hand on the turn and the river. While we
won't in reality have perfect information, we do
have the advantage of position and will usually
know if our hands are likely to win at showdown
and can bet accordingly.

We now need to figure out what percentage of our
raises on the flop should be value raises given these
conditions, and it turns out that under the above
condition, only 31.6 percent of our flop raising
range needs to be a value hand.

The equity of our bluffs has increased by 20
percent while the equity of our value hands
has decreased by 20 percent, yet since we raise
more bluffs than value hands on the flop, this
caused the overall equity of our range to increase.
Furthermore, if we didnÅft lower our value to bluff
raising ratio on the flop, we would get to the river
with too many strong hands and our opponent
could exploit us by folding all his bluff catchers.

In fact, as we change the equity of our value raises
or bluff raises, we can see a very clear causation. If
all else is equal, increasing the equity of either our
value hands or semi-bluffs allow us to bluff more
aggressively on the flop. In other words, the more
equity our value raises and bluff raises have, the
more weighted towards bluffs our raising range
should be. This leads to the following rule:

ÅeWhile the exact ratio will change based on the
board texture and cannot be solved for, a good rule
of thumb is to have around 2 bluff raises for every 1

value raise on the flop when in position.d:\work\kindle\holdem\189.png @@ Players often get confused when talking about
draws in polarized ranges since they are used to
hands in polarized ranges either being clear value

like a bluff when it misses. In fact, itÅfs often useful
to remind ourselves that Ågbetting a draw on the flop
is either a value bet or a bluff; we're just not sure
which one.Åh

We can also use the same equation used earlier
to figure out how many bluff combos are needed
to add to our raising range for each draw we raise.
Furthermore, whether a draw allows us to bluff
additional or fewer hands depends on how many
streets are left, stack depth, and how much equity
the specific draw has.

While the previous model gives us a good idea of
how strong a hand needs to be to value raise on the
flop and go all in on the river, there are a few other
nuances we must be aware of when raising the flop.
The first is our opponentÅfs flop calling range is not
static, so he won't simply call down with the top
10.5 percent of his flop betting range. The range he
defends on the turn and river will be based on what
the turn and river card is respectively. So while our
opponent may choose to felt 10.5 percent of his flop
betting range, neither he nor ourselves know what
that range will be exactly until we see the turn and
river cards.

The equity of the hands we are ahead of on the flop
is also important. For example, suppose we have a
hand which is only behind 10 percent of the hands
in our opponentÅfs flop betting range. If he has manyd:\work\kindle\holdem\200.png @@ high equity draws in his range as well, it may not be
possible to value raise the flop and bet on many turn
and river combinations. ThatÅfs because too many
hands in our opponentÅfs range will have improved
to beat us by the river and we will lose over half the
time our river bet is called.

This is easiest to visualize by imagining an
opponent whose flop betting range consists of 10
percent nutted hands with 100 percent equity and
20 percent combo draws with 45 percent equity.
That is, when he has our value raises beat on the
flop, we'll never outdraw him, yet many draws in
his flop calling range will improve to beat us by the
river. One consequence is that this opponent will be
able to 3-bet the flop at a high frequency or call and
get to the river with the best hand too often to make
raising effective.

Lastly, there are other times to value raise the
flop even if we know itÅfs not likely all our chips
will be all-in on the river. This occurs when itÅfs
desirable to make many hands in our opponentÅfs
flop betting range fold before they are able to realize
their equity. Specifically, making our opponent
fold many hands whose equity is between 20 to 25
percent is very valuable and will encourage us to
raise more aggressively.
