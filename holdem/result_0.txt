Matthew Janda has had an interest in card games
his entire life, and began playing poker with friends
in high school before playing online cash games
in college. While originally studying business
economics at UCLA, a game theory course sparked
his interest in poker theory and optimal play.

Currently, Matthew continues to make poker
training videos for CardRunners and all of his
videos are theory based and designed to teach
players the math necessary for improving their
play without going into unnecessary or impractical
details. HeÅfs never been one to discuss what line is
best with a specific hand, but rather uses computer
programs to display what action he thinks is best
with each hand in his entire range.

Matthew is applying for medical school in 2013
and hopes to be a physician one day. HeÅfs currently
finishing up his required science classes and
volunteering, but poker remains his favorite hobby.d:\work\kindle\holdem\017.png @@ Acknowledgements

About ÅgBluff CatchingÅh

by Mason Malmuth and David Sklansky

Because we at Two Plus Two know that many of
the readers of this book are presently intermediate
players who play against non-experts, we felt that it
was necessary to add an important point regarding
this advanced text.

One of the main aspects of Game Theory Optimal
Play that Matthew Janda emphasizes is that you
should usually strive to stop your opponent from
showing a profit if he were to bet all of his hands.
From this axiom, he derives many of his strategies.

To keep an opponent from gaining from constantly
bluffing profitably you need to make a lot of calls
with mediocre hands. That is, hands which are only
bluff catchers since they wonÅft beat a legitimate bet.

Our concern is that those of you who are not
playing against experts may not realize that the
calling strategy that Janda assumes may be too
loose for your game. For instance, if your opponent
bets the pot, you should theoretically call withd:\work\kindle\holdem\021.png @@ about half your hands which usually include many
weaker ones.

Janda mentions a few theoretical exceptions. But
the biggest exception occurs in games that Janda
doesnÅft usually address. Namely games when you
are playing against players who are very tight or
very timid. So if your opponent bets the pot ina
situation where, even before he bet, you thought he
was a big favorite to have a monster, bluff catching
calls will just lose money. Similarly, if you are
against someone who will often be beaten, it makes
no difference if you know he almost never bluffs.
Hence, if he bets, you should almost always fold.

This book is designed to develop and explain
the math and theory behind no-limit Texas hold

should be played against Ågperfect,Åh or theoretically
optimal, opponents. It will show how many
winning players approach the game and with talent
and hard work, give the tools needed to continue to
develop as a player.

Many of the concepts in this book have been largely
ignored by the poker community, and the few
players who understand them usually like to keep
this information private. On the other hand, many
winning players are not even aware these concepts
exist since they are not required to beat strong
opponents. However, difficult concepts shouldnÅft
be ignored if your goal is to slowly tune your game
closer to Åggame theoretically optimalÅh with the
purpose of moving up in stakes and beating other
strong players. While itÅfs true no-limit hold Åfem is
far from a ÅgsolvedÅh game, players who understand
theory well will usually be the players best able to
recognize and exploit their opponentÅfs mistakesd:\work\kindle\holdem\023.png @@ and make sure their opponents are not able to easily
exploit them.

The theory and hand examples all focus on 6-
max. This game is my specialty where IÅfve played
almost all of my hands. Nevertheless, nearly all the
concepts discussed will be transferable to 9-max
and heads-up games. The majority of the theory
will even be useful in other poker games such as
Omaha.

Note that some important poker concepts have
been left out of this book, or are only mentioned
briefly. Life and bankroll management skills, tilt
control, and understanding how to implement
reads are all-important skills every great poker
player needs. But these topics have already been
discussed numerous times elsewhere in great
detail.

Therefore, my goal is to present theoretical
concepts as clearly as possible, and for your
learning not to be encumbered by unnecessary
mathematics and terminology. To assist in
accomplishing this, I will frequently be using the
pronoun Ågwe.Åh There are two main reasons. First,
it helps get us in the right mind set. We're on the
same team with the same goal; to greatly increase

which perspective weÅfre analyzing the hand.

Lastly, please note the book is divided into 16
sections: theory intensive content and hand
examples. The theory intensive content is the larger
portion of the book and presents the necessary
information for balancing hand ranges and bet
sizes. The hand example section of the book puts
the theory into practice and shows how players
attempting to play close to optimal will balance

The Basicsd:\work\kindle\holdem\026.png @@ The Basics

Introduction

One of the difficulties with discussing poker
theory is itÅfs not usually possible to talk about
single concepts in isolation. For instance, itÅfs
impossible to adequately discuss flop play without
also understanding river play, and itÅfs difficult
to comprehend why position is so advantageous
without a solid fundamental understanding of how
equity works. This makes approaching poker theory
for the first time feel somewhat daunting.

This section is designed to quickly introduce many
important theoretical concepts before discussing
them in detail. The goal is not to make sure all of
these concepts are fully understood, but rather
make them somewhat familiar so they can be
explained mathematically and showcased with
examples in future sections.

If you're already a winning no-limit holdÅfem

Pot odds are the ratio of the current size of the pot
to the cost of a potential call. If, on the river, a player
bets $30 into a $50 pot, the potential caller will be
risking $30 to win $80 and is said to be getting pot
odds of $80-to-$30 or 8-to-3. And for his call to be
profitable, he must win at least 27.3 percent of the
time.

bluff for $30, he risks $30 to try to win $50. This
produces pot odds of $50-to-$30 or 5-to-3, and
for his bluff to be profitable, his bluff needs to be

successful at least 37.5 percent of the time.

hand or range. It also takes into account that the
pot will sometimes be split. In addition, itÅfs also
important to note that because a hand has more
equity than another hand, it does not make it a

HereÅfs an example. A reasonable opponent opens in
middle position and itÅfs folded to us on the button.

We would rather call with the

hand other than simply the handÅfs total equity.d:\work\kindle\holdem\030.png @@ Retaining Equity

Against Strong Ranges

We want to emphasize playing hands which have
a high amount of equity against our opponentÅfs
betting and calling range. Hands which only have
a high amount of equity against those hands our
opponent will frequently fold by the river are much
less useful. Unfortunately, simply looking at the
equity of a hand against a range using computer
software will not take this key difference into
account.

For instance, one of the reasons why ace-nine
offsuit is a poor call on the button against a middle
position open is because it has so much equity
against the opponent's check-folding range.
Specifically, ace high with no kicker is usually too
weak to be checked on all three streets to try to
win at showdown, but when we do bet the hand,
its equity is never realized since all worse hands in
our opponent's range should fold. In addition, on
the flop, ace-nine offsuit will almost never beat any

D

hands in the opponentÅfs value betting range and itÅfs
unlikely to improve when behind. And lastly, when

we do have a pair and our opponent does check, itÅfsd:\work\kindle\holdem\031.png @@ unlikely heÅfll be check-calling multiple streets with

On the other hand, consider nine-eight suited.
While itÅfs unlikely nine-eight suited will flop a hand
which beats strong hands our opponent will value
bet on the flop, it will however often flop a flush
draw, straight draw, or a pair with five outs. These
draws all have the potential to become strong hands
which can beat hands in our opponentÅfs value
betting or check-calling range.

In addition, nine-eight suited also utilizes its
equity efficiently when it flops a draw but does not
make a strong hand. We can semi-bluff on the turn
or river if our opponent checks and we donÅft have
a pair, and if he does check-call our turn bet, our
draw outs will almost certainly be live. Therefore,
notice that suited connectors are usually profitable
holdings since when they do make the best hand,
theyÅfll usually be strong enough to beat hands in
our opponent's value betting and check-calling
range. In addition, when they donÅft make strong
hands and are instead used as bluffs, they will
almost always make our opponent fold better hands
so little equity is wasted.d:\work\kindle\holdem\032.png @@ ÅgHand SignalingÅh

To See Additional Cards

ÅgHand signalingÅh occurs when our hand tells us
whether or not we should try to see additional cards
to make the best hand by the river. For instance,
after seeing a flop with a suited connector, we'll
almost always know exactly what we need in order
to make the best hand, and weÅfll usually want to
see a turn card if we flop a pair, straight draw, flush
draw, or three to a flush and three to a straight.
Since we only fold suited connectors on the flop and
turn if our hand has little equity, if we donÅft see a
river card, itÅfs unlikely we would have outdrawn our
opponent on the river anyway. !

1 Of course, this assumes a normal size bet with additional chips still
in play.

Other hands do not allow us to effectively call on
the flop and give ourselves a chance to outdraw our
opponent. This occurs frequently with weak pocket
pairs. If he bets, we'll usually have to fold since our
pair only beats bluffs and doesnÅft have enough outs

cards, as it will be 46.8 percent of the time, we can
call again and hope to make the best hand on the
river (and sometimes bluff if we donÅft improve and
our opponent checks to us).

While we may get lucky immediately on the turn
with sixes, if we do not immediately hit our set, we

Hand Equity Distribution

on Different Board Textures

As we'll see in future chapters, hands which flop
or turn either a lot or a small amount of equity
are better than hands which always flop or turna
medium amount of equity. In other words, a hand
which has 100 percent equity on the flop one-third
of the time and 0 percent equity two-thirds of the
time is better than a hand which always has 33.3
percent equity (on the flop). Notice that despite
both hands having the same average amount of
equity, itÅfs much easier to realize the equity of
strong hands than it is to realize the equity of
marginal hands.

HereÅfs an example. On the flop, our opponent goes
all in for a $100 bet into a $50 pot and our hand has
33.3 percent equity, we should fold since 40 percent

equity is needed to profitably call.

Equity To Expected
Value

Throughout this book, we'll be using both the
terms expected value (EV), sometimes written
as expectation, and equity. Oftentimes players
get these two concepts confused, and while
we should keep in mind that they are related,
expected value and equity are not interchangeable.
Specifically, expected value of a hand tells us how
much we expect to win on average and considers
all the money previously invested in the pot as
dead money. This means folding at the point of
calculation always has an expectation of zero
regardless of whether we lose money overall on the
hand.

In addition, expected value is not solved for by
taking the equity of a hand and multiplying it
by the size of the pot unless every player in the
hand is all in. For instance, suppose we flop a set
in an 8 big blind pot and the hand has 90 percentd:\work\kindle\holdem\037.png @@ equity against our opponentÅfs flopping range.
Inexperienced players may incorrectly assume the
expected value of the hand is 7.2 big blinds.

does not solve for the expected value of the hand
unless both players are already all in. In fact, the
expectation of this hand will be higher than 7.2 big

So in conclusion, despite being unable to convert
equity directly into expected value, a clear
correlation between expected value and equity
exists. And we will regularly look at the equity of
our hands to figure out which ones should be used
as calls, value raises, bluff raises, and folds since we

Simply Be Ranked

From Strongest
To Weakest

Since having more equity does not necessarily
make a hand better, hands cannot be ranked from
strongest to weakest. This means that different
types of holdings will be useful indifferent spots
and we must not get in the habit of thinking
some hands are always better than others. This
is especially true preflop since a slight change in
stack depth or position can significantly impact the
expected value of a hand.

For instance, against a button opener who has a
wide range, a hand like king-ten offsuit will work
much better as a call from the big blind than a
hand like seven-five suited. ThatÅfs because cold
calling with king-ten offsuit keeps the buttonÅfs
weaker kings and tens in his range while 3-bettingd:\work\kindle\holdem\039.png @@ would make most of them fold. Since the buttonÅfs
opening range is so wide, we do not need to make an
extremely strong hand by the river to usually have
the best hand and win a reasonable sized pot. But
seven-five suited plays less effectively as a call since
it will more often flop the second best pair which
includes making the same pair but with a weaker
kicker.

On the other hand, seven-five suited will play
much better in a 3-bet pot than king-ten offsuit.
Here, stronger hands are required to win at
showdown than in raised only pots, and seven-five
suited has the potential to make more very strong
hands than king-ten offsuit. In addition, this allows
us to double barrel semi-bluff the turn effectively
when we hold a straight or a flush draw since if
we hit our draw, we will almost always make the
best hand. Finally, there is the problem that 3 bets
preflop greatly increases the chances that king-ten
is ÅgdominatedÅh (by KK, TT, AK, AT, KQ, or KJ).

We must remember that some hands will play
better as calls and others will play better as semi-
bluff raises, and our job as a strong theoretical
player will be to put hands into the right ranges
against tough opponents. Unfortunately, there is

preflop and flop raising ranges, but itÅfs most clearly
illustrated on the river. When a player bets on
the end heÅfs usually doing it either with a bluff to
make stronger hands fold or with a strong hand

The opposite of a polarized range is a Ågdepolarized
rangeÅh which we will refer to as a Ågcondensed

medium strength hands and has few or no strong or

board texture where giving additional cards with
strong hands is risky.

ItÅfs worth noting that a polarized range of strong

our strong and weak hands, when we donÅft raise
we're left with a condensed calling range which is
usually quite problematic. That is, our opponents
can effectively make large bets when they know our
range is condensed since their value hands cannot
be beat. Therefore, we will sometimes need to
slowplay strong hands against skilled opponents to
prevent them from being able to overbet against us
effectively.

Lastly, ranges do not have to be polarized or
condensed. This often occurs on the flop in raised

Value Betting
and Bluffing

ItÅfs often tempting to try to oversimplify complex
situations by taking a binary or Ågall or nothingÅh
approach. This often makes problems easier to
visualize and understand, and while being able
to break down complex situations in an effort to
better understand them is often useful, we must
be careful not to go overboard. This concept can
be seen clearly in poker when players attempt to
visualize bets on the flop and turn as either value
bets or bluffs. Oftentimes, especially on the flop, the
best line available will be to make a bet which has
both bluffing and value betting properties.

that our opponent may call with AK, AQ, 98s, 88, or
77, and we'll usually win at showdown if the turn

Notice that this makes the hand seem like a value
bet since we are getting value from worse hands.
Yet we also make our opponent fold hands such
as ace-jack and king-queen which have over 24
percent equity against our holding because they
do poorly against our overall betting range which
includes many overpairs and better overcards.
Thus, making our opponent fold hands with 24
percent equity is a significant accomplishment.
This is especially true when there are two streets
left to act, a large amount of stack depth, and our
opponent has position on us. In fact, if we do decide
to bet our pair of nines with a ten kicker on this flop,

keep getting value on almost any turn or river
cards?

2. Was betting the flop really a Ågvaue betÅh if we

bet this flop and our opponent calls since we will
often have a difficult time realizing our equity

oversimplification.

Furthermore, in general, the terms Ågvalue betÅh (or
Ågvalue raiseÅh) and ÅgbluffÅh will be imperfect terms
on every street except the river. ThatÅfs because
there are always additional cards to come on earlier
streets, and weaker hands have the opportunity to
improve and outdraw stronger ones. In addition,
since not all value hands and bluffs have the same
amount of equity, some will be more likely to win at
showdown than others.

To illustrate, suppose we usually 3-bet aces and
ace-king on the button against a cutoff open. Most
players would simply refer to these 3-bets as value
raises since our opponent will often call with
dominated hands such as tens or ace-queen. Yet
there is a huge difference in strength between aces
and ace-king, as the former has much more equity.
Consequently, simply referring to these hands as
Ågvalue 3-betsÅh is an oversimplification, but one

analyzing hands. As we'll see in ÅgPart Two: Preflop
